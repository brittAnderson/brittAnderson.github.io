To convince others she<br/>was not a royal impostor she first had to convince herself. Today was<br/>different. She was, for the first time, looking forward to something. An<br/>outing. A journey away from the traps and trappings of the school and<br/>the evil eye of the severe Head Mistress. ’Gina would be with a friend,<br/>her one true school friend. The fair, loyal, intelligent, and<br/>deprecating Helene.</p><p>She tried another gown. No, too much frippery. She chose something<br/>simpler. One of the original dresses that Mietzie had given her. Mr.<br/>Goldthread had felt it was too simple for the niece of the pretender to<br/>the throne, but he relented eventually. It was silk, and blue, and she<br/>could move in it, and it still had some faint odor of home about it.</p><p>One last twirl before the looking glass was followed by a light series<br/>of raps at her door that ’Gina immediately recognized as the timid taps<br/>of Helene.</p><p>“Come in Helene.”</p><p>The door slowly opened and Helene’s cute face appeared glancing around<br/>the edge. “Oh. You look so beautiful Janus.” Everything Helene said<br/>sounded sincere, and this compliment made ’Gina blush. The daughter of a<br/>servant girl had trouble seeing herself as anything but a servant girl.</p><p>“Oh. Helene. You flatterer.” But ’Gina followed this scold by going over<br/>to take her friend’s arm in hers, and together they began to leave the<br/>room. “Are we walking?” ’Gina teased.</p><p>“No! Daddy sent his coach.” Helene shifted her voice into a lower<br/>register to imitate her father, “We will not have a descendant of the<br/>Kaiserkönig line striding over here like the postman.” The two girls<br/>laughed, and Helene continued, “You will like Daddy though. He is very<br/>charming, and our cook has been in agony over what she will make you.”</p><p>Coming out into the afternoon sun ’Gina saw before the school’s front<br/>door a small knot of children and some teachers and staff. A coach more<br/>grand than the one she had come in stood before them. It was led by<br/>three pairs of stallions. Two footmen were before the door. One with the<br/>stepping stool placed and steadied. The other held the door. The driver<br/>faced forward, and Helene paused for a moment whispering to ’Gina. “This<br/>is the ambassadorial carriage. I have never been in it by myself<br/>before.” And Helene turned to look with surprise at her friend who she<br/>now realized must be much more than the “rich girl” she had assumed.</p><p>’Gina did not respond. She appeared distracted by the carriage, but in<br/>reality she was doing all she could to keep from running and shouting,<br/>for she spied across the street a dirty little figure huddled in a<br/>corner. His hair was a tangle and his face was black. He was gnawing the<br/>heel of a loaf of hard black bread. But through the grime she recognized<br/>Willie. Willie was here. The moment he saw her looking at him he started<br/>and retreated further into the alley behind him until his shadow<br/>shielded him. He is worried ’Gina thought. He is not here to see me, or<br/>greet me, he is here to watch me. Her expression became grave, which<br/>suited the expectations of the Ambassador’s servants who escorted Helene<br/>and her guest, Janus, niece of the pretender from Kaiserkönig into the<br/>coach.</p><p>While Helene’s father did dote on her, the suggestion to invite Janus to<br/>dinner had apparently not been motivated by paternal affection only. The<br/>coach took the most circuitous route imaginable to the ambassador’s<br/>residence. Every street and resident in the city was to see the favor<br/>bestowed on the Ambassador, and by extension his country of Andalonia,<br/>by the House of Kaiserkönig. As if it were a diplomatic visit, he had<br/>the royal crest of Kaiserkönig hung upon the carriage abutting that of<br/>the royal house of Andalonia. All the other embassies and consulates<br/>were sure to note the slow parade of the carriage with its pair of<br/>heralds hanging on the doors. The long and circuitous ride did not<br/>bother the two girls. They bounced on the red royal plush inside, and<br/>took turns gazing out of one side and then the other. Helene indicated<br/>points of interest, and ’Gina had trouble maintaining the ruse that she<br/>was a jaded royal. ’Gina delighted in her guided tour of the royal city.<br/>She was after all still a servant’s child by rearing and experience.<br/>Raised in a royal home ’Gina was familiar with the warren ways of<br/>servant staff, and had glimpsed some of the regal marvels as she swept<br/>or dusted or followed the butlers explanations of protocols and<br/>dynasties, but she had never seen a city, really. Let alone a royal<br/>city. It would never have occurred to imagination to have guessed she<br/>would one day view it from an Ambassador’s carriage.</p><p>At last their time on display ended. The driver pulled up before the<br/>Embassy where excited and impulsive Helene swung open the carriage door<br/>and leaped down eager to guide her friend inside. Footmen scurried to<br/>place step stools, but were too late as Janus became ’Gina for a moment<br/>and followed her friend with a long leap from the carriage to the<br/>sidewalk. Again the two girls looped arms. Obviously watched from the<br/>house, and afraid of further breaches of decorum and protocol, the large<br/>embassy doors swung open and the Ambassador, his wife, and Diego stood<br/>on the steps in greeting. Seeing their formality ’Gina was disappointed,<br/>and it showed in a frown. This expression helped cement her return to<br/>character, and it was effective in making the Ambassador purse his lips<br/>in reflection. Helene hurried her friend up the steps and made, in<br/>monotone and from memory, the formal words of introduction her father<br/>had said were required. ’Gina, happy to be at a home again, and ready to<br/>relax from her constant vigilance of the school smiled at them all, even<br/>Diego, and responded with warm, sincere words of appreciation and thanks<br/>for the invitation. ’Gina gave a brief spontaneous hug to the<br/>ambassador’s wife who returned it while the Ambassador tutted about<br/>protocol. Still he reached out to tousle his daughter’s hair as he<br/>escorted their esteemed guest inside.</p><p>Dinner took place in the Ambassador’s formal dining room. ’Gina had<br/>hoped for something less rigid. She had viewed the outing with the<br/>expectations of seeing her girlfriend’s home; however, Helene’s father<br/>had viewed it as a chance for social climbing and national lobbying. It<br/>was an unusual hybrid. Numerous courses of tiny samples were served. A<br/>devastating amount of silver gleamed at each place (and ’Gina knew what<br/>each piece was and what each piece was for as she had been schooled by<br/>hours spent in polishing and table setting all under the supervision of<br/>the second butler). One by one each piece was used to spear an asparagus<br/>tipped with Hollondaise, or a few bites of flaky, buttery sole meunier,<br/>and on and on. Interspersed among the servings, manipulated and managed<br/>by a servant who stood silently behind each chair, was girl talk, school<br/>talk, and family gossip.</p><p>Helene was just concluding the story of the bee and ’Gina grew red with<br/>a combination of revived indignation and embarrassment. “You are a bit<br/>more revolutionary than one would expect?” commented the Ambassador.</p><p>“Noblesse oblige” responded ’Gina.</p><p>“Well said,” replied the Ambassador. “Vous parlez Français?”</p><p>“Bien sûr Ambassador, mais je prefere Anglais”</p><p>“Ganz genau. English it is.”</p><p>“Dankeschön. Das ist sehr nett von Ihnen.” replied ’Gina.</p><p>At this the Ambassador had a belly laugh, though the rest of the company<br/>looked confused. “Never mind. Never mind.” he said on seeing the<br/>family’s puzzled looks. “This one is very clever.” And he smiled again<br/>at ’Gina and wagged an admiring finger, but now the smile was only on<br/>his lips and not in his eyes.</p><p>Dinner conversation proceeded along more neutral terms, but ’Gina had<br/>been put back on her guard by this testing of the Ambassador and the<br/>slightly feral nature of his smile. Diego spoke little. Usually simply<br/>to echo an observation of his father’s and to comment on its justness.<br/>’Gina could see now how Diego resembled his father. Smaller, fatter, but<br/>with the same look of cunning sometimes peaking out behind his facade.<br/>Helene’s mother, in response to prodding by the father, asked ’Gina<br/>questions about the Kaiserkönig realm. She had spent some weeks there as<br/>a child. ’Gina did the best she could with her memory of the guidebook<br/>facts she had been schooled in by Monsieur Franz. It seemed to satisfy<br/>the mother, whose own memory did not seem too secure on the matter, and<br/>may in fact have been asking questions based on the same books. But if<br/>Helene’s mother suspected anything she did not convey it. Helene’s<br/>mother seemed much more in the mold of Helene, and she added a story of<br/>her own school girl days when she had once been punished for sneaking<br/>out to see a boy from the town. The Ambassador had tried to interrupt<br/>the story, but Helene’s mother persisted, perhaps egged on by the<br/>shocked looks on Diego’s face and the giggles coming from Helene and<br/>’Gina.</p><p>Following on this was more innocent conversation, as if it was another<br/>course, and indeed it synchronized with the delivery of the Tiramisu<br/>with its caramelized topping flamed into place at each diner’s place.<br/>“So tell me,” the Ambassador began in a voice slyly different and more<br/>probing than before, “how does your Aunt view the current situation in<br/>the capitol. We in Andalonia have complicated feelings on the current<br/>alliances.”</p><p>This was clearly an invitation to entrapment or exposure. The Ambassador<br/>was probing to see if ’Gina, that is Janus, had been sent to the capitol<br/>to look for alliances on behalf of her ambitious and bitter Aunt, or it<br/>could have been an invitation to confess treason so that he could curry<br/>favor with the Queen’s house by exposing ’Gina. Mostly, on hearing this<br/>question, ’Gina felt indignant on behalf of the Queen. Again, ’Gina<br/>understood to a greater degree the deceit and scheming that every day<br/>surrounded her Majesty. In her indignation ’Gina mustered one of the few<br/>answers that could have sailed her through these twin threats. “My Aunt<br/>views the situation in the Capitol as one not fitting for idle<br/>discussion at dinner parties with people one has just met.” ’Gina<br/>punctuated her response by a snake-eyed stare at the Ambassador. He<br/>returned her stare unsmiling, but after several seconds a decision<br/>seemed to have been made. With a jolly, “Ah, wise advice from a wise<br/>woman. What else should one expect?” The more convivial mood was<br/>reestablished.</p><p>With this, the Ambassador’s wife chimed in with “ Please, Benedict. No<br/>more politics. Let the girls be school girls.”</p><p>“Of course, my Dear. That is as it should be.” The Ambassador smiled at<br/>Helene and his wife, and glanced without a smile at ’Gina. Then seeming<br/>to gather his humor he gave a shrug and cracked the coating of his<br/>desert with a spoon. As he did this a man entered from a side door and<br/>came directly to the Ambassadors chair, bowed down with a single bend at<br/>the waist, and placed his lips beside the Ambassador’s ear. The servant<br/>spoke so that no one else could hear, see his lips move, or deduce the<br/>importance of the topic from his expression. Ah, ’Gina thought, he has<br/>his own Mr. Goldthread. Something important has happened.</p><p>His message delivered, the man stood, and without acknowledgment of the<br/>ongoing dinner or the people eating it, glided out of the room with<br/>barely a hush from his soft steps on the carpet.</p><p>“I am afraid that a matter of some urgency has arisen.” And here he<br/>again paused for several seconds to stare at ’Gina. “Dinner must be<br/>concluded.”</p><p>“But Papa!” Helene spoke loudly, impulsively. “We haven’t finished<br/>dessert. Janus hasn’t seen my room. You said she could stay and visit<br/>awhile, and you said…”</p><p>The Ambassador stood up abruptly, his chair tumbled back to the floor.<br/>No one moved, not even the footman whose job it was to pull back the<br/>seat when the Ambassador rose. He yelled at Helene, all the while<br/>looking at ’Gina. “You will go to your room immediately.” And with the<br/>gesture he used to emphasize his command he sent his dessert spoon<br/>flying. It struck one of the other immobile footmen behind the<br/>children’s side of the table. “Diego!” he shouted. Diego leaped to his<br/>feet, sending his chair flying backwards, but the footman behind Diego,<br/>alerted by the spoon to the chest (a spoon which still hung to his front<br/>by its sticky caramel end) caught the chair before it hit the floor and<br/>deftly pulled it back. “My Father.” Diego replied while standing to<br/>attention.</p><p>“You will escort Miss Kaiserkönig back to her school. Now.”</p><p>“The route Father?” By this question, Diego revealed himself to be other<br/>than the dullard he so convincingly played at school.</p><p>Pausing for a moment to think, the Ambassador said sarcastically, and<br/>after a sideways glance at ’Gina, “I guess you had better go back the<br/>way you came. That is after all the way. Isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes Father.” came Diego’s obedient response.</p><p>“Excuse me,” the Ambassador said, and without waiting for responses<br/>strode out of the room using the same door the quiet man had used.</p><p>When ’Gina next looked at the Ambassador’s wife she saw her mouth hung<br/>open. “My heaven’s!” the woman said while rising. The footman behind her<br/>pulled back her chair a look of relief on his face. “I do apologize Miss<br/>Kaiserkönig.” The Ambassador’s wife glanced in the direction that a<br/>sobbing Helene had run off. “This is not customary, but the duties of my<br/>husband’s position can be pressing and unexpected, and …” The<br/>Ambassador’s wife seemed to have run out of explanation, and ’Gina<br/>jumped into spare her embarrassment.</p><p>“I do understand very well Madam Ambassador the tensions provoked by<br/>professional obligations.”</p><p>“How well put, Miss Kaiserkönig. You are truly a most remarkable young<br/>woman. I do hope we have the privilege of meeting again. Perhaps under<br/>more social and less formal circumstances. For now, I am afraid, I will<br/>have to retire to see to my husband and daughter and ask you to please<br/>allow Diego to take you back by our carriage to your lodgings at<br/>school.”</p><p>Various servants rustled about. Wraps were found. A coat brought for<br/>Diego. Footstools presented. And a very short time later Diego sat with<br/>’Gina in the carriage as it retraced its wandering route along<br/>Ambassadorial lane to the school. ’Gina opened her curtains to watch the<br/>city go by, though with much less interest than before. She was<br/>distracted by her thoughts. As was Diego, though he did not keep quiet.<br/>He seemed to feel a bond had been developed by this experience. A bond<br/>between children with demanding and important guardians. “Wow.” he said.<br/>Then for emphasis, “Wooow!”</p><p>“Does that happen often at your house?” ’Gina asked without taking her<br/>eyes from the view through her carriage side window.</p><p>“No. Never. I mean Dad will lose it in private sometimes. I have heard<br/>him throw stuff in his office, but he always comes out looking calm. And<br/>he has never lost it at an official dinner.”</p><p>“Official dinner? Helene invited me as a friend!”</p><p>“Yeah. I know, but you have to be used to this right? You’re a<br/>Kaiserkönig. Can you really have friends?” Diego did not mean his<br/>comment to be mean. He thought what he said should be obvious. “I don’t<br/>mean Helene of course. She’s for real. I mean generally. You know that<br/>everyone has to want something. My father is the Ambassador of<br/>Andalonia. You had to know he was going to try and score points out of a<br/>visit from a Kasierkönig. Andalonia needs trade deals.”</p><p>And ’Gina’s eyes grew moist at this. She thought of her talks with<br/>Albrecht, his fencing instructor. The spoiled Mietzie. The cautious<br/>Queen. And herself, scholar and spy, learning nothing important on this<br/>adventure, but how no one could be trusted, and how passing for<br/>“important” meant disdaining relationships for anything but monetary or<br/>information value. Then, from her window, ’Gina spied the Queen’s<br/>carriage. ’Gina blanched. She knew all those servants, and none of them<br/>knew she was here. What would happen if one of them saw her and spoke?<br/>She slunk back into her seat. Diego, catching sight of her face and<br/>movements glanced out his window and misinterpreted the source of her<br/>fear.</p><p>“Oh. The Queen’s carriage. Don’t worry. No one will bother you. Our<br/>carriage carries the Andalonian seal. We are on good terms with the<br/>Queen. Her men will let us pass. They won’t want an incident.” Diego<br/>revealed himself to be an astute Ambassador in training. The footmen of<br/>the Queen’s carriage, she was clearly inside the residence before which<br/>it was parked, observed the official Ambassador’s carriage approach and<br/>lined themselves up in some form of official acknowledgment. In<br/>response, the Andalonian carriage slowed to a walk as it passed, and the<br/>Andalonian foot men took off their hats. After which the Queen’s<br/>carriage men did the same. Diego, spoke over his shoulder to ’Gina.<br/>“They always do this. It’s hilarious. The order is really important. The<br/>Queen’s men always take their caps off after we do.” He then reached out<br/>the window to wave to one of the Queen’s carriage men. By the street<br/>lights ’Gina could see the faces of the Queen’s carriage men as they<br/>passed. All held themselves to attention with eyes averted, accept for<br/>the one that Diego waved to. He was as erect as the others, but he<br/>smiled when they drew opposite and gave a broad wink to Diego. Diego<br/>turned around and said to ’Gina. “That’s Jimmie. He’s a friend of one of<br/>our footmen and comes by the house a lot. He does magic.”</p><p>’Gina had been pressed deep into the carriage, as far from the Queen’s<br/>men as she could be, but when Diego turned to speak Jimmie followed<br/>Diego’s gaze with his own eyes to see to whom it was that Diego had been<br/>speaking. At this moment a gaslight from ’Gina side of the street shone<br/>through her the drawn curtain of her window to illuminate her face. Her<br/>gaze met Jimmie’s. She watched his smile disappear in surprise, and then<br/>she saw his face grow dark and a sneer curl his lip. The carriage, now<br/>past the Queen’s, resumed its trot and distanced itself from the Queen’s<br/>retinue. Diego and ’Gina heard some vague shouting and looked at each<br/>other in confusion. Then there was a loud thunk from ’Gina side of the<br/>carriage.</p><p>“What was that Diego?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” then to the coachman, “Coachman. What was that sound?”</p><p>“Can’t say Master Diego. Everything is fine up here. No road debris.<br/>Footmen?” he shouted. And two Oys echoed back an all okay from behind.<br/>While startling, it was not clearly threatening, and ’Gina was<br/>preoccupied with what would be the effect of Jimmie’s seeing her. She<br/>had been sure he would recognize her, but when she saw that cold look of<br/>hatred on his face, she began to doubt herself. Did he really take her<br/>for a Kaiserkönig? Was that the reason he stared with such hatred. Even<br/>as a Queen’s man, such an open display of contempt would have been<br/>intolerable, even towards an enemy, let alone a young girl riding in an<br/>Ambassadorial carriage. She could not puzzle out the connection. And<br/>Diego knew him. Did that mean something. He visited the Ambassador’s<br/>residence to see a friend? Must have been often if Diego knew him well<br/>enough to learn of his magic past.</p><p>Diego sensed ’Gina’s disquiet, but he did not understand it. He thought,<br/>with his perspective as the son of an Ambassador that it must have<br/>something to do with the bad state of relations between the Queen and<br/>her estranged distant cousin the Countess of Kaiserkönig. He made one or<br/>two efforts at conversation, but then let ’Gina be, and he simply<br/>watched the nighttime streets pass by his carriage window.</p><p>Eventually, the Ambassador’s gauche, bragging parade route of a path<br/>came to an end in front of the school. Footmen opened doors. Footstools<br/>were placed. Diego descended first and offered his hand to ’Gina as he<br/>had seen gentleman do for ladies. ’Gina took it as form and without<br/>warmth, and still lost in her thoughts turned to watch Diego ascend, the<br/>footstools to be removed, the footmen to climb up, and the coachman to<br/>crack his whip and snap his reigns to move the horses on the wide u-turn<br/>that would turn the carriage back upon its way. Diego waved to her from<br/>his window, and after the carriage had turned around he waved again from<br/>what had been ’Gina’s side. ’Gina waved back, and as Diego passed ’Gina<br/>saw glinting in the street light a few inches below the window’s sill<br/>the sparkling silver sheen of the exposed portion of the blade of a<br/>throwing knife embedded in the carriage door.</p></root><a href="chapter13">Prior Chapter Going Postal</a><p><a href="chapter15">Next Chapter …—…</a></p></body></html>
