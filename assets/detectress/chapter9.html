And they became less fun. There were no more fanciful days exploring the implications of Euclid’s axioms (including that odd parallel one) or taking field trips in which she played the part of a young Linnaeus classifying dicotyledons. Regina and Monsieur Franz still practiced French, as that was the parlor language of the aristocratic and diplomatic classes. Membership in the upstairs world required sufficient knowledge to chuckle appropriately at the young men’s latest <b>bon mot</b>. Even her history lessons had been degraded by her upcoming academic placement: From the vast and admirable personages of 5000 years of human history, Regina was now reduced to memorizing the family trees of contemporary notables. Each wayward cousin of some significant (mostly by birth, but occasionally through merit) someone-or-other knew every other. It was this web of recognition that served the function of a password for their aristocratic set. If Regina was to spring fully formed into society, if her charade was to have any chance of succeeding, she must have a familiarity with all the players, and so she studied the Clarences, Esmereldas, and Hunkerstein-Filipowiczs that seemed to make up a disproportionate share of nobles; and who had the unfortunate practice of reusing and recombining given names so that it was necessary to distinguish Clarence Alex von Hunkerstein from Alex Clarence Hunkerstein-Filipowicz. They in turn must be distinguished from the many sisters and cousins who regularly swapped Clarice for Clarence and Alexis for Alex. And then there were the children, hybrid sons and daughters of all the Clarences, Alexes, Alexises, and Clarices that blossomed into new hyphenated variants. And that was just the Prussian branch.</p><p>Today, again, Regina and Monsieur Franz sat in the small pantry classroom while he guided her through another branch of another family tree. Regina sketched the “exalted” personages on a small slate. Seeing the shape of the tree helped her to remember and trace the connections. She was engrossed in one such lineage when a shadow fell across her chalk and slate and she heard Monsieur Franz speak in greeting.</p><p>“Ah, Herren Stoll und Gafner. Swiss Time. Forgive me and my pupil for not being completely finished. I should have anticipated your punctuality.”</p><p>Looking up Regina saw two of the Swiss Guards. These were the two she had first seen at tea. Gray clad, fit but not bulky, they filled the small doorway in both its vertical and horizontal dimensions. They responded with grunted <b>Genau</b>s.</p><p>Monsieur Franz continued. “I had requested tea for your arrival. I thought it might help us ease into the lesson.” And then in a louder voice, “Cook, could you have the tea brought in please?”</p><p>As these preparations were made, the two Swiss came into the room and took two places at the small writing table that functioned as bench, demonstration platform, writing table, desk, and, as now, tea table. The service was set quickly, and after Cook had left Monsieur Franz continued with introductions.</p><p>“Regina. I understand that you have seen these two gentlemen before. This is Herr Hans Gafner and is associate Herr René Stoll. As you know, they are part of the complement of the Queen’s guards. Although it is most likely unnecessary, Her Majesty has asked that you be provided with additional instruction in self-defense. Likely unnecessary. Of course… but, one should be prepared for even unlikely eventualities. And so, here they are; to participate in the instruction.” Monsieur Franz seemed nervous discussing this topic. He distracted himself by beginning to pour the tea while asking after preferences for milk or sugar.</p><p>“Herr Franz is correct as to our assignment,” said Herr Gafner “but with such a short time for preparation we must focus on the practical more than the technical. There is no time to make you a master of Judo or the Vougle, as we will if your education in defense is to continue, but we can emphasize certain useful tactics.” At this point Herr Stoll reached into a pocket and took out a cube of sugar and extended his arm towards Regina. “This sugar cube is one of several we will provide you with. It has been saturated with a tasteless sedative that acts very rapidly. It is not deadly, but it does incapacitate, and while there is an agent that can rapidly reverse its effects there will be no need for you to have that. But be assured it is safe, though effective. You may not be able to disable an adversary through force, but if you can trick them into consuming one of these you will have achieved the same effect. And that is to be your first lesson, the one we will practice today, how to trick a person into such consumption.”</p><p>Regina reached forward to take the offered sugar cube from Herr Stoll, and there was a tremor in her right hand. Her clumsy and nervous reach caused her to bump the table sending the hot tea in the gentlemen’s cups cascading in waves over their rims and saucers to drip into their laps. The three men abruptly stood wiping at the stains, while Regina apologized with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Pas de problem.” said Herr Stoll. “It is a rather frightening prospect to imagine oneself incapacitating another, but you will come to master it through our supervision and practice.”</p><p>“Bien sûr!” said Monsieur Franz after a sip of his tea. “Regina is very capable. Very creative. I am sure she will master her nerves and perform whatever lessons you have for her.” And he took another sip of tea. Both of the Swiss guards picked up their cups and made to do the same when they looked at Regina, then looked at each other, and then with the faintest of smiles looked back at Regina while placing their teacups back onto the saucers. “I think we agree with Monsieur Franz. You are a very capable young student.” Monsieur Franz smiled proudly while sipping his tea. “Tell me Regina.” Herr Gafner continued, “What do you think is one effective way to get someone to take this sedative without their knowing?”</p><p>“Put it in something they might eat or drink?”</p><p>“And how would you do that without their noticing?”</p><p>“Create a distraction, maybe?”</p><p>“Yes. Create a distraction. That was to be our first lesson, but I believe you have already mastered that, haven’t you Regina? Regina show us the sugar cube Herr Stoll gave you.”</p><p>But before Regina could respond all three heard Monsieur Franz emit a very loud “Oh my, I don’t feel well.” And it was only a very quick action on the part of Herr Stoll that kept Monsieur Franz’s face from planting itself on the table. With Herr Stoll tilting Monsieur Franz back so that his lips parted slightly Herr Gafner reached into another pocket and took out a small brown vial with an eye dropper in the lid. He used it to slowly drop five drops onto Monsieur Franz’s tongue. Within a few seconds there was a loud snort as if Monsieur Franz was awakened from sleep by his own snoring. Herr Stoll released his support, and Monsieur Franz slowly shook his head from side to side as he regained his wits. “Oh Regina.” he sighed audibly disappointed.</p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose!” she protested. “I was trying to get to his cup.” Regina gestured toward Herr Stoll. “But you took the wrong one.”</p><p>Monsieur Franz made no response, but stood slowly, and with shaky dignity, “Regina. It is most important that you succeed in your tasks, and I can only guess there is an element of danger involved if such means are viewed to be a necessary part of your preparation. Therefore, I can bear you no ill will, but I will excuse myself from any further participation in these lessons.” And then, cautiously, and with one hand trailing along the wall, he left the room.</p><p>The two Guards watched him go. “Ein guter Mensch,” said Herr Gafner. “Genau,” responded Herr Stoll.</p><p>“Now Regina. We will assume you have mastered the distraction lesson, and that you do not need further instruction from us on that front. You have also observed the effects of the sedative, and know now how cautious you must be. Here are six more sugar cubes. Keep them safe, and keep them hidden.” Herr Stoll handed her what looked like a small box of matches, and in doing so he briefly slid the lid open to reveal the cubes packed tightly inside. “Now, perhaps you will tell us how it is you came to master this distraction lesson on your own?”</p><p>“Oh. It was not on my own. Jimmie taught me. He is one of the footmen. He grew up in a carnival family. He does magic and showed me how a little distraction allowed you to do tricks right under people’s noses. I spent a lot of time with Jimmie when I was little. He is fun.”</p><p>“And were there any other carnival skills you learned from Jimmie?”</p><p>“I can kind of throw a knife a little bit.”</p><p>The two Guards turned to face each other again, and again turned back to look at Regina with what seemed to be just the trace of a smile. “Perhaps you would demonstrate this for us.” While saying this Herr Stoll gestured to a wooden post exposed in the wall between and behind them. Herr Gafner removed from a small sheath on the outside of his boot a short, flat bladed knife. He handed it to Regina handle first. She took it and reversed it to hold it with a light grasp on the flat part of the blade away from the edges. Then, with a deft little flick, she sent the knife flying between the two men’s heads (and neither flinched) to softly embed itself in the wood.</p><p>“You would not kill a man with that, but it not a skill one would expect you to possess, and therefore it could come in very handy. However, on this mission it would not look right to have you showing up wearing a throwing knife. Should the occasion arise, I will have boots and blades made for you, but let us hope that day does not come.” Despite the words, his voice seemed to hint that in fact he hoped such days did ensue. It was Regina’s secret, romantic wish that such days might happen. She was rather infatuated with the idea of sporting a knife in her shoes just like the Swiss Guards.</p><p>“Perhaps Herr Stoll, we will focus on the final lesson. You are small Regina. You are obviously capable, but if a trained man were to attack you, you would not be able to overcome him. However, an untrained man is another matter. There, surprise might be enough. Such a man is likely to come at you from behind, so we have three strategies. First, you scream if you can. Most people seeing a man grab a girl will assume the man evil if they hear you scream and they will come to your aid. Knowing this, the man will try to cover your mouth. To make him release you you will stamp on his foot as hard as you can. Come here.”</p><p>As Regina rose to come around the table Herr Gafner stood and pulled up the cuffs of his pants to show that he was wearing two different boots. He gestured to the one on his right foot. “This is the practice boot, Regina. Remember that. It is a special practice boot. It has two metal bands under the leather that are slightly separated, and there is a small battery and a small buzzer. If you stomp down on this boot hard enough you can make the two pieces of metal touch, and the buzzer will ring. Let’s try.” And before Regina had time to react or scream she was gripped across the torso by a strong arm, while the other hand clamped across her mouth and nose making it impossible to breath. She started trying to tap the foot she knew was below her. There. She felt it. “We are not dancing Regina!” Herr Gafner sounded angry. Regina began to squirm with panic. Then she saw Herr Stoll before her. He was speaking calmly.</p><p>“No Regina. No panic. The foot. The foot. It is all you think about. The foot. Hard.” She hit it, but there was no sound. Herr Gafner growled, “How long before you faint Regina? Perhaps I was wrong. You are still too little a girl. Your mother will be so disappointed.”</p><p>Herr Stoll took her face and pointed it at his. Sweetly he said, “Do not listen to the man who has you. Do not care what the man who has you says. You are Regina, knife throwing Amazon. Now stomp on that foot! Break it.”</p><p>And Regina stopped her squirming. She closed her eyes. She felt the body holding her, the arms that wrapped her, the leg that braced itself against her, and she ’saw’ the foot in her mind’s eye. It was beneath her. Between her own two legs and she leaped up swiftly in the grasp that held her, and came down on the foot. “Ha!” She heard the grunt behind her, but still no buzz. Then Herr Stoll’s voice encouraging. “Yes Regina, that is it. Stomp it. Harder. Harder.” And Regina responded with purpose and force. Now bracing herself with one leg the other went up and down repeatedly, pounding the heel into the foot of the other. “Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.”</p><p>The arms released her. Regina bent over sucking in her breath, and she heard the two men clapping, and cheering, and her anger dissolved into pride when she saw the happiness on their faces. She sat back down onto a chair, and tried to compose herself. Her breathing slowed, and finally she could say, “Shall we try again? I seemed to take too long that time.”</p><p>The two guards smiled at her. “No. There is no need to practice that again right now. We have one last lesson, or perhaps we should say gift, or maybe award, because you have earned it.”</p><p>Herr Gafner took from his pocket a small flat box about three inches on a side. It was black velvet, and hinged on one side. He opened it to face her and she saw lying inside a small bracelet. It was a narrow silver band with an etched pattern like snakes’ scales. There were two small transverse joints where it appeared that two semi-circles of silver had been fused together and on one side there was a slight thickening as if the bracelet were a snake that had recently swallowed a prey. It was beautiful in a way, but what was more surprising to Regina was that she recognized it. The Queen wore one, always, though the Queen’s was larger. Herr Gafner took it from the box. “This,” he said “is a special product made by our Quaestor. Our local adjutant if you will. He is our leader, but he is also talented at making useful tools for us in our work. He calls this product the snake. You might think that is because of the scales, but in reality it is because that just like a snake it has fangs.” Grabbing the side of the bracelet with the bump in one hand he pulled it apart from the other side where it separated at the fine transverse joints. On the opposite side there were two small holes, and on the side with the bump, which Herr Gafner now held in his hand, there extended two short, but very sharp, needle points. “This is your weapon of last resort. If you cannot escape, and your life is at risk. Use it. Aim for the eyes.”</p><p>With those gruesome instructions Herr Gafner snapped the two rings together around her wrist, and he and Herr Stoll stood up straight. “You have done very well today Regina. But do not be over confident. We will see you here again tomorrow for more distraction, stamping, and poking practice. I have ordered grapes. We will use those to simulate eyeballs. Should your snake need to bite there can be no squeamishness. No hesitation.”</p><p>Then without pausing for her response, the two made short bows, said “Auf wiederluge.” and left her alone rubbing the silver scaly band that encircled her left wrist.</p></root><a href="chapter8.html">Prior Chapter Mucking</a><p><a href="chapter10.html">Next Chapter Preparations</a></p></body></html>
