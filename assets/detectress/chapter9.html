And theybecame less fun. There were no more fanciful days exploring theimplications of Euclid’s axioms (including that odd parallel one) ortaking field trips in which she played the part of a young Linnaeusclassifying dicotyledons. Regina and Monsieur Franz still practicedFrench, as that was the parlor language of the aristocratic anddiplomatic classes. Membership in the upstairs world required sufficientknowledge to chuckle appropriately at the young men’s latest <b>bon mot</b>.Even her history lessons had been degraded by her upcoming academicplacement: From the vast and admirable personages of 5000 years of humanhistory, Regina was now reduced to memorizing the family trees ofcontemporary notables. Each wayward cousin of some significant (mostlyby birth, but occasionally through merit) someone-or-other knew everyother. It was this web of recognition that served the function of apassword for their aristocratic set. If Regina was to spring fullyformed into society, if her charade was to have any chance ofsucceeding, she must have a familiarity with all the players, and so shestudied the Clarences, Esmereldas, and Hunkerstein-Filipowiczs thatseemed to make up a disproportionate share of nobles; and who had theunfortunate practice of reusing and recombining given names so that itwas necessary to distinguish Clarence Alex von Hunkerstein from AlexClarence Hunkerstein-Filipowicz. They in turn must be distinguished fromthe many sisters and cousins who regularly swapped Clarice for Clarenceand Alexis for Alex. And then there were the children, hybrid sons anddaughters of all the Clarences, Alexes, Alexises, and Clarices thatblossomed into new hyphenated variants. And that was just the Prussianbranch.</p><p>Today, again, Regina and Monsieur Franz sat in the small pantryclassroom while he guided her through another branch of another familytree. Regina sketched the “exalted” personages on a small slate. Seeingthe shape of the tree helped her to remember and trace the connections.She was engrossed in one such lineage when a shadow fell across herchalk and slate and she heard Monsieur Franz speak in greeting.</p><p>“Ah, Herren Stoll und Gafner. Swiss Time. Forgive me and my pupil fornot being completely finished. I should have anticipated yourpunctuality.”</p><p>Looking up Regina saw two of the Swiss Guards. These were the two shehad first seen at tea. Gray clad, fit but not bulky, they filled thesmall doorway in both its vertical and horizontal dimensions. Theyresponded with grunted <b>Genau</b>s.</p><p>Monsieur Franz continued. “I had requested tea for your arrival. Ithought it might help us ease into the lesson.” And then in a loudervoice, “Cook, could you have the tea brought in please?”</p><p>As these preparations were made, the two Swiss came into the room andtook two places at the small writing table that functioned as bench,demonstration platform, writing table, desk, and, as now, tea table. Theservice was set quickly, and after Cook had left Monsieur Franzcontinued with introductions.</p><p>“Regina. I understand that you have seen these two gentlemen before.This is Herr Hans Gafner and is associate Herr René Stoll. As you know,they are part of the complement of the Queen’s guards. Although it ismost likely unnecessary, Her Majesty has asked that you be provided withadditional instruction in self-defense. Likely unnecessary. Of course…but, one should be prepared for even unlikely eventualities. And so,here they are; to participate in the instruction.” Monsieur Franz seemednervous discussing this topic. He distracted himself by beginning topour the tea while asking after preferences for milk or sugar.</p><p>“Herr Franz is correct as to our assignment,” said Herr Gafner “but withsuch a short time for preparation we must focus on the practical morethan the technical. There is no time to make you a master of Judo or theVougle, as we will if your education in defense is to continue, but wecan emphasize certain useful tactics.” At this point Herr Stoll reachedinto a pocket and took out a cube of sugar and extended his arm towardsRegina. “This sugar cube is one of several we will provide you with. Ithas been saturated with a tasteless sedative that acts very rapidly. Itis not deadly, but it does incapacitate, and while there is an agentthat can rapidly reverse its effects there will be no need for you tohave that. But be assured it is safe, though effective. You may not beable to disable an adversary through force, but if you can trick theminto consuming one of these you will have achieved the same effect. Andthat is to be your first lesson, the one we will practice today, how totrick a person into such consumption.”</p><p>Regina reached forward to take the offered sugar cube from Herr Stoll,and there was a tremor in her right hand. Her clumsy and nervous reachcaused her to bump the table sending the hot tea in the gentlemen’s cupscascading in waves over their rims and saucers to drip into their laps.The three men abruptly stood wiping at the stains, while Reginaapologized with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Pas de problem.” said Herr Stoll. “It is a rather frightening prospectto imagine oneself incapacitating another, but you will come to masterit through our supervision and practice.”</p><p>“Bien sûr!” said Monsieur Franz after a sip of his tea. “Regina is verycapable. Very creative. I am sure she will master her nerves and performwhatever lessons you have for her.” And he took another sip of tea. Bothof the Swiss guards picked up their cups and made to do the same whenthey looked at Regina, then looked at each other, and then with thefaintest of smiles looked back at Regina while placing their teacupsback onto the saucers. “I think we agree with Monsieur Franz. You are avery capable young student.” Monsieur Franz smiled proudly while sippinghis tea. “Tell me Regina.” Herr Gafner continued, “What do you think isone effective way to get someone to take this sedative without theirknowing?”</p><p>“Put it in something they might eat or drink?”</p><p>“And how would you do that without their noticing?”</p><p>“Create a distraction, maybe?”</p><p>“Yes. Create a distraction. That was to be our first lesson, but Ibelieve you have already mastered that, haven’t you Regina? Regina showus the sugar cube Herr Stoll gave you.”</p><p>But before Regina could respond all three heard Monsieur Franz emit avery loud “Oh my, I don’t feel well.” And it was only a very quickaction on the part of Herr Stoll that kept Monsieur Franz’s face fromplanting itself on the table. With Herr Stoll tilting Monsieur Franzback so that his lips parted slightly Herr Gafner reached into anotherpocket and took out a small brown vial with an eye dropper in the lid.He used it to slowly drop five drops onto Monsieur Franz’s tongue.Within a few seconds there was a loud snort as if Monsieur Franz wasawakened from sleep by his own snoring. Herr Stoll released his support,and Monsieur Franz slowly shook his head from side to side as heregained his wits. “Oh Regina.” he sighed audibly disappointed.</p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose!” she protested. “I was trying to get to hiscup.” Regina gestured toward Herr Stoll. “But you took the wrong one.”</p><p>Monsieur Franz made no response, but stood slowly, and with shakydignity, “Regina. It is most important that you succeed in your tasks,and I can only guess there is an element of danger involved if suchmeans are viewed to be a necessary part of your preparation. Therefore,I can bear you no ill will, but I will excuse myself from any furtherparticipation in these lessons.” And then, cautiously, and with one handtrailing along the wall, he left the room.</p><p>The two Guards watched him go. “Ein guter Mensch,” said Herr Gafner.“Genau,” responded Herr Stoll.</p><p>“Now Regina. We will assume you have mastered the distraction lesson,and that you do not need further instruction from us on that front. Youhave also observed the effects of the sedative, and know now howcautious you must be. Here are six more sugar cubes. Keep them safe, andkeep them hidden.” Herr Stoll handed her what looked like a small box ofmatches, and in doing so he briefly slid the lid open to reveal thecubes packed tightly inside. “Now, perhaps you will tell us how it isyou came to master this distraction lesson on your own?”</p><p>“Oh. It was not on my own. Jimmie taught me. He is one of the footmen.He grew up in a carnival family. He does magic and showed me how alittle distraction allowed you to do tricks right under people’s noses.I spent a lot of time with Jimmie when I was little. He is fun.”</p><p>“And were there any other carnival skills you learned from Jimmie?”</p><p>“I can kind of throw a knife a little bit.”</p><p>The two Guards turned to face each other again, and again turned back tolook at Regina with what seemed to be just the trace of a smile.“Perhaps you would demonstrate this for us.” While saying this HerrStoll gestured to a wooden post exposed in the wall between and behindthem. Herr Gafner removed from a small sheath on the outside of his boota short, flat bladed knife. He handed it to Regina handle first. Shetook it and reversed it to hold it with a light grasp on the flat partof the blade away from the edges. Then, with a deft little flick, shesent the knife flying between the two men’s heads (and neither flinched)to softly embed itself in the wood.</p><p>“You would not kill a man with that, but it not a skill one would expectyou to possess, and therefore it could come in very handy. However, onthis mission it would not look right to have you showing up wearing athrowing knife. Should the occasion arise, I will have boots and bladesmade for you, but let us hope that day does not come.” Despite thewords, his voice seemed to hint that in fact he hoped such days didensue. It was Regina’s secret, romantic wish that such days mighthappen. She was rather infatuated with the idea of sporting a knife inher shoes just like the Swiss Guards.</p><p>“Perhaps Herr Stoll, we will focus on the final lesson. You are smallRegina. You are obviously capable, but if a trained man were to attackyou, you would not be able to overcome him. However, an untrained man isanother matter. There, surprise might be enough. Such a man is likely tocome at you from behind, so we have three strategies. First, you screamif you can. Most people seeing a man grab a girl will assume the manevil if they hear you scream and they will come to your aid. Knowingthis, the man will try to cover your mouth. To make him release you youwill stamp on his foot as hard as you can. Come here.”</p><p>As Regina rose to come around the table Herr Gafner stood and pulled upthe cuffs of his pants to show that he was wearing two different boots.He gestured to the one on his right foot. “This is the practice boot,Regina. Remember that. It is a special practice boot. It has two metalbands under the leather that are slightly separated, and there is asmall battery and a small buzzer. If you stomp down on this boot hardenough you can make the two pieces of metal touch, and the buzzer willring. Let’s try.” And before Regina had time to react or scream she wasgripped across the torso by a strong arm, while the other hand clampedacross her mouth and nose making it impossible to breath. She startedtrying to tap the foot she knew was below her. There. She felt it. “Weare not dancing Regina!” Herr Gafner sounded angry. Regina began tosquirm with panic. Then she saw Herr Stoll before her. He was speakingcalmly.</p><p>“No Regina. No panic. The foot. The foot. It is all you think about. Thefoot. Hard.” She hit it, but there was no sound. Herr Gafner growled,“How long before you faint Regina? Perhaps I was wrong. You are stilltoo little a girl. Your mother will be so disappointed.”</p><p>Herr Stoll took her face and pointed it at his. Sweetly he said, “Do notlisten to the man who has you. Do not care what the man who has yousays. You are Regina, knife throwing Amazon. Now stomp on that foot!Break it.”</p><p>And Regina stopped her squirming. She closed her eyes. She felt the bodyholding her, the arms that wrapped her, the leg that braced itselfagainst her, and she ’saw’ the foot in her mind’s eye. It was beneathher. Between her own two legs and she leaped up swiftly in the graspthat held her, and came down on the foot. “Ha!” She heard the gruntbehind her, but still no buzz. Then Herr Stoll’s voice encouraging. “YesRegina, that is it. Stomp it. Harder. Harder.” And Regina responded withpurpose and force. Now bracing herself with one leg the other went upand down repeatedly, pounding the heel into the foot of the other.“Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.”</p><p>The arms released her. Regina bent over sucking in her breath, and sheheard the two men clapping, and cheering, and her anger dissolved intopride when she saw the happiness on their faces. She sat back down ontoa chair, and tried to compose herself. Her breathing slowed, and finallyshe could say, “Shall we try again? I seemed to take too long thattime.”</p><p>The two guards smiled at her. “No. There is no need to practice thatagain right now. We have one last lesson, or perhaps we should say gift,or maybe award, because you have earned it.”</p><p>Herr Gafner took from his pocket a small flat box about three inches ona side. It was black velvet, and hinged on one side. He opened it toface her and she saw lying inside a small bracelet. It was a narrowsilver band with an etched pattern like snakes’ scales. There were twosmall transverse joints where it appeared that two semi-circles ofsilver had been fused together and on one side there was a slightthickening as if the bracelet were a snake that had recently swallowed aprey. It was beautiful in a way, but what was more surprising to Reginawas that she recognized it. The Queen wore one, always, though theQueen’s was larger. Herr Gafner took it from the box. “This,” he said“is a special product made by our Quaestor. Our local adjutant if youwill. He is our leader, but he is also talented at making useful toolsfor us in our work. He calls this product the snake. You might thinkthat is because of the scales, but in reality it is because that justlike a snake it has fangs.” Grabbing the side of the bracelet with thebump in one hand he pulled it apart from the other side where itseparated at the fine transverse joints. On the opposite side there weretwo small holes, and on the side with the bump, which Herr Gafner nowheld in his hand, there extended two short, but very sharp, needlepoints. “This is your weapon of last resort. If you cannot escape, andyour life is at risk. Use it. Aim for the eyes.”</p><p>With those gruesome instructions Herr Gafner snapped the two ringstogether around her wrist, and he and Herr Stoll stood up straight. “Youhave done very well today Regina. But do not be over confident. We willsee you here again tomorrow for more distraction, stamping, and pokingpractice. I have ordered grapes. We will use those to simulate eyeballs.Should your snake need to bite there can be no squeamishness. Nohesitation.”</p><p>Then without pausing for her response, the two made short bows, said“Auf wiederluge.” and left her alone rubbing the silver scaly band thatencircled her left wrist.</p></root><a href="chapter8.html">Prior Chapter Mucking</a><p><a href="chapter10.html">Next Chapter Preparations</a></p></body></html>
