<body><h2>Chapter - Duty</h2><p>‘Gina’s life seemed to become a life comprised solely of teas and<br/>tutors. Her attendance was requested more often, sometimes daily.<br/>Although she spoke little, the Queen’s children became used to her<br/>presence. They smiled to see her there. These teas were only some of her<br/>daytime activities. ’Gina was still required to take short shifts with<br/>chambermaids and valets, wash sheets, roll out pastry dough, and<br/>otherwise perfect her downstairs skills. These domestic training tasks<br/>did not free her from scholastic responsibilities as Monsieur Franz<br/>began to appear more and more to sit in the kitchen, or the pantry, or<br/>the laundry, and to pronounce in French the names of all the items. He<br/>made ‘Gina repeat them along with short discussions of her duties. “When<br/>we are done,” he pronounced, “you will be able to mop the floors at<br/>Versailles with the best of the French petites filles.” ’Gina sweating<br/>as she used her hot pad to grab a freshly reddened iron from its place<br/>on the grate smiled at the the presumed compliment.</p><p>But when it was dark, and the house stilled (as even the Royal House did<br/>from time to time) ‘Gina found herself in her mother’s bed where they<br/>rubbed their feet against each other to warm themselves. ’Gina told her<br/>Mother stories of the day. ’Gina repeated her lessons from Euclid, or<br/>how Albrecht broke the fencing master’s sword, or what a poem was (it<br/>seemed to her Mother not much more than a song written by someone too<br/>lazy to compose a tune), and once she recited <b>en Français</b> a small<br/><b>conte</b> she had heard of a young girl forced to serve a castle, “just<br/>like me Mother”, who later, through magical intervention, wed a Prince<br/>and ruled herself. Her Mother loved to hear ‘Gina talk, though she<br/>understood very little, but it made ’Gina’s mother worry too for ‘Gina<br/>was being made a girl who would not be content with a downstairs life.<br/>Her Mother could be satisfied with a peaceful life, a fair food ration,<br/>meaningful work, and a royal duty, but could Regina? ‘Gina’s mother<br/>gloried in the blossoming of her daughter’s mind and world, and so she<br/>beamed smiles as the young girl spoke. ’Gina’s words gradually slowed<br/>down, and finally, with a murmured “glass slippers”, she eventually slid<br/>into sleep. Then, alone with her thoughts and her daughter’s soft snores<br/>making her sleepy, the smile would fade from her mother’s face, and a<br/>frown would crease her mother’s brow as she slid into a mother’s worried<br/>sleep.</p><p>‘Gina’s frequent tea attendance led to a slight change of family habits.<br/>It seemed Mr. Goldthread came to fetch her not only more often, but also<br/>earlier. Mr. Goldthread would leave ’Gina alone in one of Mietzie’s<br/>beautiful hand me downs, perched on the edge of an uncomfortable chair,<br/>afraid to move for creasing the dress or breaking some rule of which she<br/>was ignorant. Alone in the vast room where tea was to appear ’Gina would<br/>sit and watch servants finish their preparations. They would give ’Gina<br/>a wink, and she would allow herself a slight smile and a nod, but all<br/>was formal and a bit intimidating. ’Gina knew that the rules with<br/>Mietzie in the pantry could not be extended to the upstairs domain.<br/>Still, with each early arrival ’Gina became more comfortable. As ’Gina’s<br/>early arrivals became more common so too did early arrivals of the<br/>Queen’s children.</p><p>First, it was Albrecht. He was striding through the room one day, mud on<br/>his boots, crop beating against his thigh, mumbling to himself as he<br/>hurriedly went to dress when he saw ‘Gina silent and rigid in her chair.</p><p>“Why Regina! What on Earth are you doing here?”</p><p>“Waiting for tea.” she replied. It was possible that her cheeks<br/>reddened, or it may have been the angle of the light.</p><p>“Really? Now? What was Goldthread thinking? We don’t meet for a while.<br/>Why don’t you go to Mietzie’s quarters?”</p><p>“Mr. Goldthread was quite specific. My permit is this room, and this<br/>room alone. He said he had other matters, and I was to await tea here.<br/>He was very direct.”</p><p>“Well. Let’s call Mietzie. You know I know Morse code too. They teach it<br/>to the Guards, and one of them taught me. MIETZIE!” he yelled.</p><p>“WHAT?” she screeched back. The cry came faintly echoing back to them,<br/>seeming to come from the walls.</p><p>“It’s those corridors you all use. We learned we could talk to each<br/>other if we yell loud enough. Mother isn’t too keen on it though.” He<br/>said this to ‘Gina. Then loudly “LISTEN!” And he began to jump up and<br/>down clomping his boots loudly on the parquet floor. His steps echoed<br/>off the walls and through the house, and as he finished, the air became<br/>dusty with the dirt kicked up by his boots. One butler opened the door,<br/>saw Albrecht apparently dancing, and closed it again. But ‘Gina knew<br/>what he had done. He had used Morse code, the clacking and the clomping<br/>of the boots, to signal Mietzie she was here. She admired his<br/>discretion. A few moments later there came back to them a resonant<br/>clacking that translated to, “I’m coming.”</p><p>After this it was more and more often that Albrecht happened through on<br/>his way back from his rides. And more and more often Albrecht found<br/>Mietzie sitting with the early ‘Gina. Sometimes he changed and sometimes<br/>he stayed, and his Mother, the Queen, somehow seemed unaware of his<br/>dusty dress on these occasions. Now, more often than not, all the<br/>children found themselves in place and chatting when the Queen arrived<br/>to ring the official bell that produced the hot pot and cakes which were<br/>poured for all, sugar and cream in inverse proportion to ages. For the<br/>youngest, it was essentially only sweetened milk.</p><p>The boys spoke of cravats and knights’ fables. The girls spoke of<br/>dresses and warrior princesses. Often there was talk of gossip: both<br/>upstairs and down, and often it was ‘Gina who ended up talking the most.<br/>’Gina interpreted for the children the whys of peoples actions. The<br/>royal children knew only a life of structure and order. For them it came<br/>as enlightening that people might do things for other reasons as well.<br/>The children enjoyed the downstairs gossip most of all. For them it was<br/>the Arabian Nights: tales from a far off land with mysterious<br/>motivations and often fantastic creatures (there was actually a man that<br/>did nothing besides run the boiler that gave them all hot baths). In<br/>reciprocation they talked honestly and openly of their own lives, and<br/>seemed to gain some insight in the telling of tales in this context.</p><p>Then one day the tea was interrupted. After the tea had been poured, and<br/>Mietzie was just beginning yet another story about her cat, again, a<br/>door could be heard to open and close. The sound, though soft, was so<br/>uncharacteristic that it led to a pause in the conversation. Mr.<br/>Goldthread who generally stood behind ‘Gina’s chair, a point that<br/>allowed him to both survey the room, and provide prompting kicks, left<br/>suddenly. “Please continue Mietzie,” the Queen said, “What did Chevalier<br/>do to Queenie?” But before Mietzie could resume her story Mr. Goldthread<br/>reappeared to stand silently behind the Queen’s chair.</p><p>With no other signal, the Queen stood. “Please continue with the tea<br/>children. I should not be long.” Then, without a word or glance<br/>exchanged, she left the room with Mr. Goldthread a close, but still<br/>deferential, distance behind.</p><p>Mietzie found it difficult to resume her story. All the Queen’s children<br/>were uneasy at this breech of protocol. ‘Gina was uneasy from sympathy,<br/>but did not know what it meant. The children sipped tea, and snacked.<br/>Time passed. After a half hour Albrecht observing his youngest siblings<br/>beginning to fidget and yawn said “Mother won’t want Arabelle and<br/>Abelard to nap at table. I had better take them to their rooms.” And he<br/>rose, bowed, and then taking a hand of each of his two sleepy siblings<br/>escorted them from the room. Slowly, the other children followed suit.<br/>Older sibling escorted out younger ones. The tea grew cold, and Mietzie<br/>signaled for the service to be removed. Albrecht returned and sat to the<br/>side reading. More time passed. Mietzie turned at last to ‘Gina. “I<br/>think it is alright if you go. I will tell Mother I gave you leave.”</p><p>Albrecht looked up to see ‘Gina’s head gazing up in reflection. Then she<br/>returned her gaze to Mietzie. “Thank you Mietzie. But although it is Mr.<br/>Goldthread who brings me, I know I am here at the Queen’s invitation,<br/>and she made it very clear that I was not to leave without being<br/>dismissed.”</p><p>“Well that’s just silly. Mother wouldn’t want you sitting here forever.<br/>Would she Albrecht?” Albrecht had come to stand beside his sister. Every<br/>time ‘Gina saw him lately he seemed to be a little different. He spoke<br/>less quickly, and she did not always understand him as she had before.<br/>Albrecht placed his free hand on his sister’s shoulder and smiled at<br/>her. Then he looked over to ‘Gina. “Here.” He handed the book he had<br/>been reading to ‘Gina. “It’s Browning. I mentioned him once, I believe.<br/>He’s my favorite.”</p><p>“What?” Mietzie said in surprise. “You don’t really think Mother expects<br/>her to stay here forever?”</p><p>“No. I do not. But I also think that ‘Gina can judge for herself what<br/>the situation requires.’’ And he was looking sympathetically at ‘Gina<br/>when he said it. “We don’t really know what Mother wants when it comes<br/>to ‘Gina, but we do know how she has treated servants she felt were<br/>disrespectful.’’</p><p>Mietzie did remember such occasions, and she bit her lip. “Come along.”<br/>Albrecht said prodding his sister with the hand that rested on her<br/>shoulder. Mietzie stood. Gave a little wave, and watched ‘Gina over her<br/>shoulder as she went out with her brother. He did not look back.</p><p>‘Gina read. For a while it was rather fun. She was in an upstairs room<br/>on her own, with a book, as if she lived here, and for awhile that kept<br/>her spirits up. But the light from the window began to dim when the sun<br/>had set. A maid came in to clear the few remaining plates and cakes.<br/>“What are you still doing here Regina?”</p><p>“The Queen did not dismiss me before she left.”</p><p>“Oh.” For the maid all was clear. “Here.” She took two of the smaller<br/>cakes and wrapped them in a napkin. “In case you get hungry later. Hide<br/>the napkin under the cushion. I’ll come by or get someone else to come<br/>by later to pick it up. And don’t you fret. You’re a good girl. I’m sure<br/>the Queen didn’t forget.” But the fact that she then wrapped a second<br/>napkin with two more cakes did not make the maid appear confident. “I’ve<br/>gotta run love, but I’ll pop by later just to say Hi, and I will let<br/>your Mum know why you’re late.”</p><p>Another half an hour and there was not enough light to read. ‘Gina<br/>closed the book and allowed herself at last to sit back in the chair.<br/>She ate one of the cakes. Then a second. ’Gina placed the napkin under<br/>the cushion. After ’Gina had finished the cakes she sat down again. Then<br/>’Gina heard footsteps clicking in a hall. ’Gina hurriedly hid the second<br/>napkin behind her. The footsteps came from an unexpected direction, from<br/>her right, though ’Gina knew the only public door was to her left. Even<br/>the hidden servants access was not on the right. A shaft of light<br/>entered the room, and the footsteps were now matched with voices.</p><p>“Oh Heavens Goldthread. It’s like pitch in here. Light a lamp.” It was<br/>the Queen’s voice, and ‘Gina saw Goldthread’s silhouette pass in front<br/>of her to the sconce near the public door. “What the bloody hell am I<br/>supposed to do? Who do I trust?” The frustration and exasperation was<br/>clear in the Queen’s voice, and she said this as the light filled the<br/>room. Her mouth was opening to speak again when something in Mr.<br/>Goldthread’s gaze made her glance to her left where ‘Gina sat, still, on<br/>the edge of her chair.</p><p>“Good gracious Regina. You startled me. But…” and the Queen’s voice<br/>changed from surprise to anger. “…what are you doing here? You are NOT<br/>allowed upstairs unattended and uninvited. You take unfair liberties<br/>with our generosity!”</p><p>Regina quickly got down from her chair and bowed, and spoke as she did<br/>so. “You did invite me Majesty. For tea.”</p><p>“But that was two hours ago. What made you think you could come back? I<br/>simply won’t have it.”</p><p>“I did not come back Majesty. I have never left. You did not dismiss me,<br/>and you expressly told me that I was never to leave your presence<br/>without an express dismissal. Remember?”</p><p>“But…” the Queen glanced at Mr. Goldthread. To all the world he wore<br/>exactly the same neutral expression, but the Queen seemed to see<br/>something else, and her tone lightened. “… you have just been sitting<br/>here for two hours? In the dark?”</p><p>“No your Majesty.” Regina was still kneeling and bowed on the floor.<br/>“Albrecht left me a book to read, until it got dark, and…”</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“One of the maid gave me two cakes to eat while I waited.” This last was<br/>blurted out. Regina did not know if she was really allowed to eat the<br/>Queen’s tea cakes when there was no one else at tea. And she worried<br/>that the Queen would now ask her the maid’s name. Regina had resolved<br/>not to tell.</p><p>The Queen continued. “One of the staff knew you were sitting here in the<br/>dark, alone, and told no one?”</p><p>There was a faint sound. It might have been a floorboard creak, or the<br/>faintest of throat clearings, or it might have been ’Gina’s imagination,<br/>but it caused the Queen to glance again at Mr. Goldthread and she<br/>sighed, “But you told them I had not dismissed you.”</p><p>“Yes your Majesty.”</p><p>“Stand up my dear. You are dismissed.” And the Queen resumed her walk,<br/>limping to where Mr. Goldthread stood.</p><p>“Thank you your Majesty.” and as Regina turned to go she added, “And I<br/>hope your gout feels better soon.”</p><p>“What?” The Queen gaped in surprise. “Who told you my gout was bothering<br/>me.”</p><p>Regina stopped and bowed her head again. “No one your Majesty. It’s just<br/>that you walk the way Cook does sometime, and I know she has the gout,<br/>and so I thought …” And then Regina thought that maybe her thoughts<br/>were not what the Queen wanted to hear about so she shut her mouth<br/>tight.</p><p>“Very observant you are, and perhaps a bit too clever, but anyway, yes,<br/>my gout is bothering me a bit, but that I am afraid is not the real<br/>cause of my distress. Or my forgetfulness. Please accept my excuse for<br/>detaining you at tea…” Queens do not apologize even when they are<br/>wrong, “ and, again, you are dismissed.”</p><p>“Thank you your majesty.” and as Regina, innocent Regina, turned to go,<br/>her heart began to warm again for the Queen who had been so<br/>understanding, and had so much upon her mind. So she added. “… and I<br/>hope you catch the spy.”</p><p>It was as if thunder had clapped within the tea room. “What!” came the<br/>loud cry from the Queen, and then louder still. “Sit!” with all the<br/>Royal imperative of decades of practice, and more commanding still, “Who<br/>has told you there is a spy?”</p><p>That the Queen, in her younger days, used to once raise her voice was a<br/>legend among the staff. Some had heard it, to be sure. The older maids<br/>and butlers, those who had been in service when the Queen was but a<br/>Princess, and had not yet grown into her position, status, wisdom, and<br/>capacity. But since she had been a mother not a single one of the<br/>Queen’s children had heard their Mother’s voice raised in anger. So<br/>there began in response to this loud command a distant wailing that came<br/>from the nursery. Moments later Mietzie, followed by Albrecht with his<br/>training epee drawn (and the point still protected by its cork), burst<br/>into the room. As they saw the scene, Mr. Goldthread standing quietly by<br/>the lamp, and their Mother taller than they remembered glowering down on<br/>young Regina, they slid to a stop. The Queen looked at Mietzie. “Out!”<br/>she said, and Mietzie fled. Then she turned to Albrecht preparing to<br/>speak again, but paused. He met her gaze. Lowered his foil, and then<br/>went and stood against the wall. The Queen followed him with a fierce<br/>gaze, but shortly turned away and addressed herself again to Regina.</p><p>“Sit!” I say, “Who has told you such a thing?” She commanded, and her<br/>tone suggested she knew of no other outcome than an answer. Mr.<br/>Goldthread, responding to some unspoken command, returned to stand<br/>behind Regina’s chair, who sat shrinking but silent. Albrecht folded his<br/>arms and leaned against the wall.</p><p>“I said,…” the Queen’s voice, though it had not seem possible a moment<br/>earlier, became even more commanding, more imperative (or perhaps it<br/>only seemed that way because every other castle noise had ceased). The<br/>Queen’s order resonated and echoed down every silent corridor.<br/>“Who-has-told-you-such-a-thing?”</p><p>Regina’ raised her head, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen limped closer, wincing with each step. “There will be no more<br/>teas for you, EVER, if you do not reply to me.”</p><p>Tears rolled down Regina’s cheeks, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen bowed forward to stare closer at ’Gina’s face, and then<br/>straightening, reflected. “And there will be no more DOWNSTAIRS CATS!”</p><p>The Queen’s face reddened with the force of her expostulation.</p><p>At this Regina’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the tears ceased to fall,<br/>and still she did not speak.</p><p>“If you do not answer me, if you do not confess the source of your<br/>insinuation, I will have your Mother, just your Mother, transferred to<br/>the Summer castle!”</p><p>And with this Regina cheeks became wet again, and her lips began to<br/>tremble, they opened once, then they shut again, and still she did not<br/>speak.</p><p>“Mother! We told her it was a secret!” Albrecht yelled, but before he<br/>could continue, she yelled back, “Silence! Of course I knew it was you<br/>children, but I did not know that God could make in one so young, such a<br/>brave and loyal subject, one who would be willing to lose privileges,<br/>pets, and family to keep her word.”</p><p>The Queen went forward, with effort going down on her own knees so that<br/>her eyes were level with the young girl’s. One hand brushed a teary<br/>cheek, and she placed her forehead against Regina’s own. “Forgive me my<br/>dear for this cruel test; it was despicable, but I had to know. You see<br/>only the delights and flash of royal prerogative. Parties, and lace, and<br/>ample cakes, but you do not see the deceit and envy and want that<br/>constantly claws at one’s royal back. You do not see the intrigues and<br/>the games that are constantly played against one, and you do not know<br/>the loneliness that accompanies the complete absence of confidence that<br/>is a Royal’s lot. I am lucky to have a few that I can trust, and I<br/>cannot tell you how happy it makes me feel to know that my children too<br/>have at least one other that they can trust, some day their lives may<br/>depend upon it, and you.”</p><p>Regina did not quite follow all that was said, but she knew their were<br/>more tears on her cheeks now than she alone had shed, and she felt her<br/>chair bump once from behind, a comforting pat of approval from the knee<br/>of Mr. Goldthread. Without reflecting ’Gina put her arms around the<br/>Queen’s neck and sobbed.</p>
