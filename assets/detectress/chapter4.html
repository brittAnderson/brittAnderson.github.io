Mietzie was true to her word, and soon ‘Gina had more beautiful hand-me-down dresses than she had teas to wear them to. But Mietzie was still a Princess with many duties, and their time for frolic was quite constrained. Mietzie had many tutors and many events, but all her breaks were spent with ‘Gina.</p><p>“Here’s another letter for you Regina.” said one of the chambermaids handing to the young girl a folded piece of thick lavender paper. Many of the downstairs staff had taken to calling ‘Gina Regina again, a slight increase in formality that accompanied her growing closeness to the royal family. They all still loved and doted on her. They neither regretted nor envied her her friendship. Regina was the sort of person for which one rooted. The staff had seen enough of Royals to know of their fickle nature. There was no reason to discourage Regina. The staff could let life teach Regina her lessons about Royal infatuations. Meanwhile, it was a very cynical person who did not share in the squeals of delight that echoed in the downstairs corridors as the two pre-teens, Mietzie and Regina, cavorted.</p><p>Despite Mietzie’s busy schedule, she and Regina corresponded as best they could across their royal divide. For lengthy correspondence they used the <b>Bed Post</b>. The chambermaid cleaning Mietzie’s rooms would find any letters Mietzie had written underneath Mietzie’s pillows. The maid would bring them downstairs to ’Gina when the maid brought down the dirty linen. Any responses written by ’Gina would be left for the same maid to place under Mietzie’s pillows the next day when the bed was made. It was a once a day exchange of events and gossip, but it was an effective way to arrange their next escapade.</p><p>Innovation though is driven by demands. Mietzie grew impatient for responses to her letters, and she chafed at not being able to send and receive shorter, more immediate messages. Thus, it was only a few weeks after the <b>Bed Post</b> had been established that Mietzie was found wandering the servants’ quarters with Queenie trailing. Mietzie had decided that they must have a better way of communicating.</p><p>“What are you doing down here now Love?” a chambermaid asked Mietzie as they passed. The rules of royal etiquette had evolved. Upstairs the staff bowed to the Royal Princess, but downstairs Mietzie was treated with respect, but without formality. She was addressed politely, but in a friendly fashion. Mietzie loved the freshness and affection such greetings contained. Upstairs, the maid knew to bow and Mietzie, reluctantly, knew she must demand it - she did not yet know why.</p><p>“Looking for ‘Gina. I sent her a letter this morning telling her that I could play. The viewing of the Palace Calvary was postponed to allow them to re-chrome the horseshoes or something.’’</p><p>“That would be my fault Dearie. Your letter is still in my pocket. I hain’t had time to get back down here ’til just now. Your Mother has guests and they are all demanding hot towels and cold sheets and better weather and other things I can’t provide. Here. I’ll go give it to her now…”</p><p>“No.” Mietzie interrupted. “You have your duties to attend to just like I do. Mother’s guests are more important.” A Princess learns to be gracious in disappointment, but a girl cannot completely hide her sorrow.</p><p>“Well, run along and see her now,” said the chambermaid. “She’s just in there with that tutor, and he never seems to be doing anything important. Like her future needs all them angles and equations. He ought to teach her how to box a bed sheet corner if he really wanted to be useful to her education.”</p><p>Mietzie did not fully comprehend the meaning of this remark, but focused on the part that made her happy, and skipped to the room where she knew ‘Gina took her lessons. Mietzie shouted a loud “Bye Maid!” over her shoulder. The Chambermaid adjusted her burden of linens and almost managed a scowl before the smile broke through and she resumed her hurried waddle.</p><p>Mietzie knocked, and then entered the tutorial room. It was a noble name for a small pantry. Into one corner of the pantry had been wedged a small table. Above the table shelving had been anchored to the wall. Surrounded by preserves and mysterious canned goods was one linear foot of shelf that was labeled “Scholastic Library.” It was so declaimed by a handwritten sign thumb-tacked to it. Presently, it held two books provided by the tutor, and which were never to leave the “classroom” - except should the space be needed for storage of the Queen’s favorite confit.</p><p>The tutor rose and bowed when Mietzie entered. Although he taught Regina downstairs, he was not a downstairs person - nor really was he an upstairs person. Scholars were in-between people. Monsieur Franz was actually more of a no-stairs person. While he followed automatically and always the formality of upstairs life, he did so with an ease and casualness that suggested he did not take it too seriously. On the the other hand, he was too worldly to be fully accepted as a downstairs person. The downstairs people mocked him in his absence as Prof. Franzy Pants - but it was just high spirits, for they liked him out for the seriousness and professionalism that they saw him devote to Regina’s lessons. Their inference was that since they understood less and less of what it was ’Gina said, Monsieur Franz must be doing a good job with her education. Monsieur Franz always addressed ‘Gina as Miss Regina, and rising from his bow, he addressed the Princess Mietzie with:</p><p>“Bon jour ma Princesse. Comment allez vous?”</p><p>“Tres bien Monsieur Franz, et vous?”</p><p>“Tout va bien pour moi. Quelle désirez-vous?”</p><p>Mietzie could see the puzzle of incomprehension on ‘Gina’s face and switched to English.</p><p>“I came to join ‘Gina’s lesson. I had a break today. The horseshoes need to be shined or something, and I don’t have to go to parade this morning.’’</p><p>“Quelle miracle. Assiez vous s’il vous plait.”</p><p>“Merci Monsieur.”</p><p>“Hey! That’s not fair speaking in code.” ‘Gina’s face grew red.</p><p>Monsieur Franz responded. “We are not speaking in code. We are speaking French, Cheri. It is a language like ours, but spoken by people who live in another country, France, and a few other places. I spoke it with my Mémé - grandmother.”</p><p>“But we <b>should</b> have a code!” Mietzie interjected. “That way I could send messages without them being read by the maids who take our letters.”</p><p>“Or we could resume our geometry lesson,” said Monsieur Franz</p><p>“What’s a code?” asked ‘Gina</p><p>“It’s a private language that only you understand!” replied Mietzie.</p><p>“If only you understood it, it might be a code, but not a very useful one.” said Monsieur Franz. Being a good tutor he saw this as an opportunity to teach, even if it was not what had been scheduled. “A code is like a dictionary. It is like a book where you look up one letter or one word and find another word, letter, or symbol to replace it. There are many uses for codes. Sometimes it is to keep things secret, as Princess Mietzie has just suggested,” and he made a little deferential nod in her direction acknowledging and encouraging her learning. “But it can also be used for other reasons. To help people translate from one language to another, or it may be efficient and economical. For instance, our telegraph uses an alphabet with just two letters: the dot and the dash; the short and the long. From a combination of these we can represent all letters in our alphabet and some punctuation. Once you have letters you can string them together to make words, from their sentences, and with patience you could write a novel in this Morse Code.”</p><p>“But why would you want to do that?” ’Gina asked. “Why not just say the words?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mietzie echoed. “Just say the words.”</p><p>“But that may not be possible Mesdemoiselles. Right now Her Highness the Queen can communicate with all her realm using a telegraph. This is a line of wire that carries electricity. It only carries electricity. It is either off or on. There are only two states. It is necessary to make a code that can build up our words from these two states.”</p><p>“Could you give us an example Monsieur Franz? I still do not understand.” ‘Gina asked. Mietzie did not quite understand either. She had heard of telegrams of course, but did not really know what they meant, but being an upstairs person she did not have Regina’s permission to admit ignorance so freely, even when she was ignorant.</p><p>He paused a moment in thought. “Ah, the bells. Princess Mietzie, when you are in bed in the morning and need your hot water bottle refreshed, what do you do?”</p><p>“I pull my bell chord.” She replied.</p><p>“And how is it that they know it is you?” He asked.</p><p>“Well. I guess there must be different bells for different rooms,” Mietzie shot a quick glance at ‘Gina who nodded encouragement. “Yes. There are different bells, and they can see which one rang because it is still moving after I pull it.”</p><p>“Well that works when they are in the bell room, but what if there is no one to see the bell? Does that mean you must suffer cold feet?” He smiled as he asked this. “No. It does not happen. There must be more, but it is not the <b>more</b> a Princess would or should know, so let us ask <b>downstairs</b>.” And he turned to look at Regina.</p><p>“They have different,” and here she slowed down to correctly pronounce a new word, “<b>pitches</b>. We know whose bell is ringing by sound alone.”</p><p>“But then there must be many different tones, excuse me, pitches? No?” asked Monsieur Franz (though he already knew the answer - Monsieur Franz could be tricky like that).</p><p>“Fifty-four. Over three octaves, and using fractional notes,” said ‘Gina. “And when the Parson from church came to visit us once when the royal family was away….” She stopped suddenly. She was revealing a secret.</p><p>“We promise to never tell,” said Monsieur Franz winking slyly at a nodding Mietzie. “We know you can trust the Princess.”</p><p>“Well.” ’Gina did not hesitate long. She wanted to tell the story. “Well. The Parson came when the Queen was away, and he sat having a tea in the bell room with the Head Valet and Head Maid. I was watching from the door. He stood up to go, and bumped his head on one of the bells, and one of the chambermaids went rushing by in a fright. She was saying ’They ain’t supposed to be anyone here.’ Her hair was really messy.” The two girls giggled, and Monsieur Franz smiled. “Anyway. The Parson called out to stop her. But then he started ringing bells on purpose, and more staff started running by. They would get stopped by the staff that had already run by. Soon there was a huge crowd outside the bell room, and all the while the Parson kept ringing the bells. Finally, one of the footmen said, sort of annoyed, ’Oy. What’cha doin’ there. Playing a bl… a symphony? Knock it off’. The Parson turned around and said, ’Not a symphony young man, a gymnopede. You know, I think I could do it now.’ And he turned around and started plucking the bells strings quite fast, and it was music. Very pretty. Very sad. But he made us all aware that the different pitches made a melody, and now when you…” and she looked at Mietzie “.. all get up in the morning or need something at the same time we all hear it as a melody, and some of the maids make up words to sing to the song.”</p><p>“Oh. How clever. What do they sing about us?”</p><p>Monsieur Franz saw Regina’s face turn red, and he gallantly jumped in. “That is part of the secret that I am afraid Miss Regina is not allowed to share.” And he smiled at her. “Now, let us return to codes. This system of the bells only works because there are 54 tones, 54 symbols, characters, letters if you will. How would it work if there were only two? And that is why the Morse code - which has only two symbols: long and short; must use a series of symbols to make one letter.”</p><p>The two girls sat in reflection on this lesson for a moment, and then Mietzie looked up with the pleasant smile of knowledge gained, but, somewhat to Monsieur Franz’s surprise, as he privately thought Regina the more able and interested tutee, Regina sat with a clear look confusion on her face. He started to clarify, but ’Gina held up a hand to make hims stop. This surprised him, but before he could take affront ’Gina looked up at him. “We could use the bells for Morse code. Will you teach us?”</p><p>“Merveilleux!” Monsieur Franz clapped his hands. Mietzie looked confused.</p><p>“See Mietzie.” ’Gina continued. “Instead of just pulling the bell a few times to get attention. You can pull it long or short jangles and make letters and send me messages.”</p><p>“Oh. Then I would have been able to tell you I was coming this morning, and we could have played instead of having a lesson,” Mietzie glanced apologetically at Monsieur Franz. “Je suis desolé Monsieur.”</p><p>“Pas de probleme. Je comprend. Vous sont jeunes filles. Vous preferez a jouer.”</p><p>“No French code!” Regina said. “Morse code.”</p><p>“I will teach you both the Morse code, and I will teach you some French. Agreed? D’accord?”</p><p>“But how will ‘Gina signal me?’’ Mietzie asked. “I can talk to her because there is a bell down here, but how will she talk to me? I won’t be able to hear it ring on my end?”</p><p>“The wires go from your room to here. There should be a way to make a wire go from here to there. And I know you two have a supporter in Monsieur Goldthread. I will tell him of your plan, in confidence <b>naturellement</b>, and we will see if he can help.”</p><p>“But the messages can’t be too long.” ’Gina said. Her thoughts had raced beyond the implementation to the practicalities. “How will we know when one of us is done? And it could get confusing if the messages are too long and we get the symbols mixed up.”</p><p>“Okay. We can have symbols for spaces and periods.” Then catching Regina’s look of insight Mietzie amended, “I’ll bet Morse code already has those, because the telegraph operators would have the same problem. How about twenty words?” Mietzie asked, and then continued without waiting for an answer. “But words can be long and short. Twenty long words could be really long. Let’s say that a word is maybe seven letters, on average. Then twenty times seven is 140. We could say that we will limit all our messages to 140 characters.”</p><p>Regina agreed. “Yes. And now we can talk even when we can’t visit. This will be so much fun.”</p><p>“Yes it will.” said Monsieur Franz, “ But first you must learn the Morse code. Let us think about this code. Are there anythings that Mr. Morse might have considered when he invented it?” And without their quite realizing it, both young girls received twice the length of lesson they would have voluntarily sat still for.</p><p>The very next day workmen appeared upstairs and down, and soon, in the bell room, was a special rope, hung low, and with a small tag labeled “For Miss Regina’s Use Only.”</p><p>And in the following weeks the downstairs and upstairs rang like a Sunday cathedral. Long peels were followed by the sounds of feet running upstairs and down. “Did you get that?” “No!” “Try again!” “Did you call me a ’fiend’?” “Sorry. I forgot how to signal ’r’.” And for the first two weeks no one got their towels or hot water bottles on time, and no one complained.</p></root><a href="chapter3.html">Prior Chapter Apologia</a><p><a href="chapter5.html">Next Chapter Duty</a></p></body></html>
