Mietzie was true to her word, andsoon ‘Gina had more beautiful hand-me-down dresses than she had teas towear them to. But Mietzie was still a Princess with many duties, andtheir time for frolic was quite constrained. Mietzie had many tutors andmany events, but all her breaks were spent with ‘Gina.</p><p>“Here’s another letter for you Regina.” said one of the chambermaidshanding to the young girl a folded piece of thick lavender paper. Manyof the downstairs staff had taken to calling ‘Gina Regina again, aslight increase in formality that accompanied her growing closeness tothe royal family. They all still loved and doted on her. They neitherregretted nor envied her her friendship. Regina was the sort of personfor which one rooted. The staff had seen enough of Royals to know oftheir fickle nature. There was no reason to discourage Regina. The staffcould let life teach Regina her lessons about Royal infatuations.Meanwhile, it was a very cynical person who did not share in the squealsof delight that echoed in the downstairs corridors as the two pre-teens,Mietzie and Regina, cavorted.</p><p>Despite Mietzie’s busy schedule, she and Regina corresponded as bestthey could across their royal divide. For lengthy correspondence theyused the <b>Bed Post</b>. The chambermaid cleaning Mietzie’s rooms would findany letters Mietzie had written underneath Mietzie’s pillows. The maidwould bring them downstairs to ’Gina when the maid brought down thedirty linen. Any responses written by ’Gina would be left for the samemaid to place under Mietzie’s pillows the next day when the bed wasmade. It was a once a day exchange of events and gossip, but it was aneffective way to arrange their next escapade.</p><p>Innovation though is driven by demands. Mietzie grew impatient forresponses to her letters, and she chafed at not being able to send andreceive shorter, more immediate messages. Thus, it was only a few weeksafter the <b>Bed Post</b> had been established that Mietzie was foundwandering the servants’ quarters with Queenie trailing. Mietzie haddecided that they must have a better way of communicating.</p><p>“What are you doing down here now Love?” a chambermaid asked Mietzie asthey passed. The rules of royal etiquette had evolved. Upstairs thestaff bowed to the Royal Princess, but downstairs Mietzie was treatedwith respect, but without formality. She was addressed politely, but ina friendly fashion. Mietzie loved the freshness and affection suchgreetings contained. Upstairs, the maid knew to bow and Mietzie,reluctantly, knew she must demand it - she did not yet know why.</p><p>“Looking for ‘Gina. I sent her a letter this morning telling her that Icould play. The viewing of the Palace Calvary was postponed to allowthem to re-chrome the horseshoes or something.’’</p><p>“That would be my fault Dearie. Your letter is still in my pocket. Ihain’t had time to get back down here ’til just now. Your Mother hasguests and they are all demanding hot towels and cold sheets and betterweather and other things I can’t provide. Here. I’ll go give it to hernow…”</p><p>“No.” Mietzie interrupted. “You have your duties to attend to just likeI do. Mother’s guests are more important.” A Princess learns to begracious in disappointment, but a girl cannot completely hide hersorrow.</p><p>“Well, run along and see her now,” said the chambermaid. “She’s just inthere with that tutor, and he never seems to be doing anythingimportant. Like her future needs all them angles and equations. He oughtto teach her how to box a bed sheet corner if he really wanted to beuseful to her education.”</p><p>Mietzie did not fully comprehend the meaning of this remark, but focusedon the part that made her happy, and skipped to the room where she knew‘Gina took her lessons. Mietzie shouted a loud “Bye Maid!” over hershoulder. The Chambermaid adjusted her burden of linens and almostmanaged a scowl before the smile broke through and she resumed herhurried waddle.</p><p>Mietzie knocked, and then entered the tutorial room. It was a noble namefor a small pantry. Into one corner of the pantry had been wedged asmall table. Above the table shelving had been anchored to the wall.Surrounded by preserves and mysterious canned goods was one linear footof shelf that was labeled “Scholastic Library.” It was so declaimed by ahandwritten sign thumb-tacked to it. Presently, it held two booksprovided by the tutor, and which were never to leave the “classroom” -except should the space be needed for storage of the Queen’s favoriteconfit.</p><p>The tutor rose and bowed when Mietzie entered. Although he taught Reginadownstairs, he was not a downstairs person - nor really was he anupstairs person. Scholars were in-between people. Monsieur Franz wasactually more of a no-stairs person. While he followed automatically andalways the formality of upstairs life, he did so with an ease andcasualness that suggested he did not take it too seriously. On the theother hand, he was too worldly to be fully accepted as a downstairsperson. The downstairs people mocked him in his absence as Prof. FranzyPants - but it was just high spirits, for they liked him out for theseriousness and professionalism that they saw him devote to Regina’slessons. Their inference was that since they understood less and less ofwhat it was ’Gina said, Monsieur Franz must be doing a good job with hereducation. Monsieur Franz always addressed ‘Gina as Miss Regina, andrising from his bow, he addressed the Princess Mietzie with:</p><p>“Bon jour ma Princesse. Comment allez vous?”</p><p>“Tres bien Monsieur Franz, et vous?”</p><p>“Tout va bien pour moi. Quelle désirez-vous?”</p><p>Mietzie could see the puzzle of incomprehension on ‘Gina’s face andswitched to English.</p><p>“I came to join ‘Gina’s lesson. I had a break today. The horseshoes needto be shined or something, and I don’t have to go to parade thismorning.’’</p><p>“Quelle miracle. Assiez vous s’il vous plait.”</p><p>“Merci Monsieur.”</p><p>“Hey! That’s not fair speaking in code.” ‘Gina’s face grew red.</p><p>Monsieur Franz responded. “We are not speaking in code. We are speakingFrench, Cheri. It is a language like ours, but spoken by people who livein another country, France, and a few other places. I spoke it with myMémé - grandmother.”</p><p>“But we <b>should</b> have a code!” Mietzie interjected. “That way I couldsend messages without them being read by the maids who take ourletters.”</p><p>“Or we could resume our geometry lesson,” said Monsieur Franz</p><p>“What’s a code?” asked ‘Gina</p><p>“It’s a private language that only you understand!” replied Mietzie.</p><p>“If only you understood it, it might be a code, but not a very usefulone.” said Monsieur Franz. Being a good tutor he saw this as anopportunity to teach, even if it was not what had been scheduled. “Acode is like a dictionary. It is like a book where you look up oneletter or one word and find another word, letter, or symbol to replaceit. There are many uses for codes. Sometimes it is to keep thingssecret, as Princess Mietzie has just suggested,” and he made a littledeferential nod in her direction acknowledging and encouraging herlearning. “But it can also be used for other reasons. To help peopletranslate from one language to another, or it may be efficient andeconomical. For instance, our telegraph uses an alphabet with just twoletters: the dot and the dash; the short and the long. From acombination of these we can represent all letters in our alphabet andsome punctuation. Once you have letters you can string them together tomake words, from their sentences, and with patience you could write anovel in this Morse Code.”</p><p>“But why would you want to do that?” ’Gina asked. “Why not just say thewords?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mietzie echoed. “Just say the words.”</p><p>“But that may not be possible Mesdemoiselles. Right now Her Highness theQueen can communicate with all her realm using a telegraph. This is aline of wire that carries electricity. It only carries electricity. Itis either off or on. There are only two states. It is necessary to makea code that can build up our words from these two states.”</p><p>“Could you give us an example Monsieur Franz? I still do notunderstand.” ‘Gina asked. Mietzie did not quite understand either. Shehad heard of telegrams of course, but did not really know what theymeant, but being an upstairs person she did not have Regina’s permissionto admit ignorance so freely, even when she was ignorant.</p><p>He paused a moment in thought. “Ah, the bells. Princess Mietzie, whenyou are in bed in the morning and need your hot water bottle refreshed,what do you do?”</p><p>“I pull my bell chord.” She replied.</p><p>“And how is it that they know it is you?” He asked.</p><p>“Well. I guess there must be different bells for different rooms,”Mietzie shot a quick glance at ‘Gina who nodded encouragement. “Yes.There are different bells, and they can see which one rang because it isstill moving after I pull it.”</p><p>“Well that works when they are in the bell room, but what if there is noone to see the bell? Does that mean you must suffer cold feet?” Hesmiled as he asked this. “No. It does not happen. There must be more,but it is not the <b>more</b> a Princess would or should know, so let us ask<b>downstairs</b>.” And he turned to look at Regina.</p><p>“They have different,” and here she slowed down to correctly pronounce anew word, “<b>pitches</b>. We know whose bell is ringing by sound alone.”</p><p>“But then there must be many different tones, excuse me, pitches? No?”asked Monsieur Franz (though he already knew the answer - Monsieur Franzcould be tricky like that).</p><p>“Fifty-four. Over three octaves, and using fractional notes,” said‘Gina. “And when the Parson from church came to visit us once when theroyal family was away….” She stopped suddenly. She was revealing asecret.</p><p>“We promise to never tell,” said Monsieur Franz winking slyly at anodding Mietzie. “We know you can trust the Princess.”</p><p>“Well.” ’Gina did not hesitate long. She wanted to tell the story.“Well. The Parson came when the Queen was away, and he sat having a teain the bell room with the Head Valet and Head Maid. I was watching fromthe door. He stood up to go, and bumped his head on one of the bells,and one of the chambermaids went rushing by in a fright. She was saying’They ain’t supposed to be anyone here.’ Her hair was really messy.” Thetwo girls giggled, and Monsieur Franz smiled. “Anyway. The Parson calledout to stop her. But then he started ringing bells on purpose, and morestaff started running by. They would get stopped by the staff that hadalready run by. Soon there was a huge crowd outside the bell room, andall the while the Parson kept ringing the bells. Finally, one of thefootmen said, sort of annoyed, ’Oy. What’cha doin’ there. Playing abl… a symphony? Knock it off’. The Parson turned around and said, ’Nota symphony young man, a gymnopede. You know, I think I could do it now.’And he turned around and started plucking the bells strings quite fast,and it was music. Very pretty. Very sad. But he made us all aware thatthe different pitches made a melody, and now when you…” and she lookedat Mietzie “.. all get up in the morning or need something at the sametime we all hear it as a melody, and some of the maids make up words tosing to the song.”</p><p>“Oh. How clever. What do they sing about us?”</p><p>Monsieur Franz saw Regina’s face turn red, and he gallantly jumped in.“That is part of the secret that I am afraid Miss Regina is not allowedto share.” And he smiled at her. “Now, let us return to codes. Thissystem of the bells only works because there are 54 tones, 54 symbols,characters, letters if you will. How would it work if there were onlytwo? And that is why the Morse code - which has only two symbols: longand short; must use a series of symbols to make one letter.”</p><p>The two girls sat in reflection on this lesson for a moment, and thenMietzie looked up with the pleasant smile of knowledge gained, but,somewhat to Monsieur Franz’s surprise, as he privately thought Reginathe more able and interested tutee, Regina sat with a clear lookconfusion on her face. He started to clarify, but ’Gina held up a handto make hims stop. This surprised him, but before he could take affront’Gina looked up at him. “We could use the bells for Morse code. Will youteach us?”</p><p>“Merveilleux!” Monsieur Franz clapped his hands. Mietzie lookedconfused.</p><p>“See Mietzie.” ’Gina continued. “Instead of just pulling the bell a fewtimes to get attention. You can pull it long or short jangles and makeletters and send me messages.”</p><p>“Oh. Then I would have been able to tell you I was coming this morning,and we could have played instead of having a lesson,” Mietzie glancedapologetically at Monsieur Franz. “Je suis desolé Monsieur.”</p><p>“Pas de probleme. Je comprend. Vous sont jeunes filles. Vous preferez ajouer.”</p><p>“No French code!” Regina said. “Morse code.”</p><p>“I will teach you both the Morse code, and I will teach you some French.Agreed? D’accord?”</p><p>“But how will ‘Gina signal me?’’ Mietzie asked. “I can talk to herbecause there is a bell down here, but how will she talk to me? I won’tbe able to hear it ring on my end?”</p><p>“The wires go from your room to here. There should be a way to make awire go from here to there. And I know you two have a supporter inMonsieur Goldthread. I will tell him of your plan, in confidence<b>naturellement</b>, and we will see if he can help.”</p><p>“But the messages can’t be too long.” ’Gina said. Her thoughts had racedbeyond the implementation to the practicalities. “How will we know whenone of us is done? And it could get confusing if the messages are toolong and we get the symbols mixed up.”</p><p>“Okay. We can have symbols for spaces and periods.” Then catchingRegina’s look of insight Mietzie amended, “I’ll bet Morse code alreadyhas those, because the telegraph operators would have the same problem.How about twenty words?” Mietzie asked, and then continued withoutwaiting for an answer. “But words can be long and short. Twenty longwords could be really long. Let’s say that a word is maybe sevenletters, on average. Then twenty times seven is 140. We could say thatwe will limit all our messages to 140 characters.”</p><p>Regina agreed. “Yes. And now we can talk even when we can’t visit. Thiswill be so much fun.”</p><p>“Yes it will.” said Monsieur Franz, “ But first you must learn the Morsecode. Let us think about this code. Are there anythings that Mr. Morsemight have considered when he invented it?” And without their quiterealizing it, both young girls received twice the length of lesson theywould have voluntarily sat still for.</p><p>The very next day workmen appeared upstairs and down, and soon, in thebell room, was a special rope, hung low, and with a small tag labeled“For Miss Regina’s Use Only.”</p><p>And in the following weeks the downstairs and upstairs rang like aSunday cathedral. Long peels were followed by the sounds of feet runningupstairs and down. “Did you get that?” “No!” “Try again!” “Did you callme a ’fiend’?” “Sorry. I forgot how to signal ’r’.” And for the firsttwo weeks no one got their towels or hot water bottles on time, and noone complained.</p></root><a href="chapter3.html">Prior Chapter Apologia</a><p><a href="chapter5.html">Next Chapter Duty</a></p></body></html>
