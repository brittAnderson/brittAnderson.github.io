The first time she began to slip off the horse. Hans barely<br/>managed to grab her. Then he switched positions so as to have her<br/>sitting in front of him. exhausted from her travels, and still with the<br/>effects of knock out drops, ‘Gina was rocked by the galloping horse into<br/>a semi-slumber. Always, when she awoke, there was the same thought: What<br/>is the plot? How do I protect Her Majesty?</p><p>The heightened security at the castle, and their rapidly approaching<br/>dust cloud, led to them being expected. Rather than the stables, Hans<br/>rode the galloping horse directly to the servants’ door at the castle’s<br/>back. ’Gina heard her mother’s shouts of “Baby Girl. Where is my baby<br/>girl?” long before she saw her. When ’Gina jumped from the horse to run<br/>to her Mother ’Gina saw, in addition to her Mother, Mr. Goldthread, the<br/>Queen, several soldiers, and a few Swiss Guards she had not met. While<br/>Mother and daughter hugged Hans conferred with the Queen, Mr.<br/>Goldthread, and the Swiss Guard’s commandant.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread broke from the group to walk toward ’Gina. Seeing him<br/>over her mother’s shoulder she began shouting, while still hugging her<br/>mother: “A plot Mr. Goldthread! Jimmie has planned something against the<br/>Queen, that is why …”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread interrupted. “Quite right young lady. Herr Gafner has<br/>told us as much, but what is the plot? What are we to defend against?”</p><p>’Gina broke from her mother’s hug, but still held her hand. She turned<br/>to face Mr. Goldthread, and saw that all the others were staring<br/>silently at her - including the Queen, whom, in the excitement of her<br/>reunion with her mother, she had forgotten was there. ’Gina dropped to<br/>her knee. “So sorry Your Majesty. In the excitement I forgot.”</p><p>“No time for that now ’Gina. No ceremony on the battlefield. What is the<br/>plot against which we must prepare?”</p><p>’Gina rose and stared back, paused, and then moaned loudly “I don’t<br/>know!”</p><p>The Queen walked toward ’Gina and extended both her hands to ’Gina.<br/>“Dear,” ’Gina took the Queen’s two hands in her own and looked up at<br/>this Woman, this Ruler, this Mother who was glancing now at the dirty,<br/>stained, caked strip of cloth that wrapped ’Gina’s little finger. “You<br/>have done so much for me. So much for your country. I came to you with<br/>suspicions of espionage, and put you where I thought a stray word might<br/>come your way and help me deduce the source of leaks. I did not expect<br/>you to be so successful in exposing and collapsing all, and to do so<br/>when you were under such risk, and when you were where you would suffer<br/>so much for your intelligence and your patriotism. suffered so much. It<br/>is enough that we know that there is a plot. All that we owe to you. Do<br/>not fret, and do not doubt your accomplishment …”</p><p>Somewhere in the course of the Queen’s complimentary speech ’Gina’s mind<br/>had begun to wander. Although he was standing in front of her, ’Gina<br/>felt as if Mr. Goldthread’s knee had jostled her chair one more time,<br/>goading her on. Those watching saw ’Gina’s head tip back slightly and<br/>her gaze go up and far away, she began to mumble out loud, which the<br/>Queen, lost in her oratory, had not noticing ’Gina’s reverie, continued<br/>“… which has been ever so much more than …”</p><p>While ’Gina softly said, “… a plot … here at the castle. That’s what<br/>he said. That’s why he wanted to distract the guards and soldiers into<br/>coming after me. Here at the castle, but what is it? The castle is a<br/>safe hold, and so it must be different. Something must be different. We<br/>must find that difference.” Then louder, ignorant of the fact that the<br/>Queen was still talking and praising her she said loudly, “Mother!”</p><p>The Queen was not used to being interrupted, but she had come to know<br/>’Gina well and excused her creative bursts. ’Gina spun around, saying<br/>again, “Mother. Mr. Goldthread. We know that whatever is to happen is to<br/>happen here. We know that because Jimmie went to so much trouble to draw<br/>the Guards away. Despite that, we know it cannot be anything as simple<br/>as a direct attack. His team was too small. There are no armies on the<br/>way. Herr Gafner and I would have seen something. And Jimmie was a spy,<br/>a subtle man. We know therefore that something is happening here, and<br/>that it is a threat, and like everything Jimmie has done, a secret and<br/>hidden, and possibly just like him, in plain sight; if we only knew what<br/>to look for. And Mother, who knows what the castle should look like best<br/>of all?”</p><p>“We do. The staff do!”</p><p>On hearing this Mr. Goldthread began to move quickly towards the castle.<br/>The Queen, Hans, ’Gina, and her mother followed. They found the<br/>surprisingly quick Mr. Goldthread already in the bell room jangling<br/>every bell loudly and randomly. Servants came running from all<br/>directions. “Bring me the head maid and head butler now!” He commanded<br/>them, and the downstairs staff that had responded immediately ran away<br/>again.</p><p>Within moments the head of the domestic staff appeared and Mr.<br/>Goldthread gave them a quick and succinct charge. A threat had been made<br/>against the Queen. It came from an unknown source, and was by an unknown<br/>method. But whatever source, and by whatever method, it would be via a<br/>route and mechanism distinct from standard household practices. No one<br/>knew their jobs, their procedures, their household better than the<br/>Queen’s personnel. They must command that each person with a diligence<br/>unnaturally enhanced and elaborated inspect and evaluate every quarter<br/>of the castle that fell under their experience and responsibility and<br/>report any anomaly - on this point Mr. Goldthread’s voice was booming<br/>and he repeated - ANY ANOMALY. No matter how small or apparently<br/>insignificant each must be reported to him. In response, and giving<br/>evidence of the staff’s professionalism and preparation, there were no<br/>questions. The Heads of household turned and immediately began<br/>dispensing down their hierarchy orders and priorities, and establishing<br/>the chain for reporting.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread turned at this point to ’Gina’s mother, but before he<br/>could speak to her, she had already begun speaking to ’Gina. “My love.<br/>Oh how I worried and missed you, and I can’t believe it, but I have to<br/>go. My duty here is clear. I must do my part.” She kissed ’Gina quickly<br/>on the cheek, and hearing her voice called with a military clarity she<br/>responded, “Here,” and walked out of the room with no hesitation. Mr.<br/>Goldthread redirected himself and speaking communally suggested that the<br/>Queen, ’Gina, and Hans would be in the way here, and that the business<br/>would be done more effectively if they removed themselves, and he guided<br/>the party away. As he did so the Queen put an arm around ’Gina’s<br/>shoulder and pulled her close to ask in a whisper, “Do you have news of<br/>Albrecht?”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>They sat in a small parlor near the Queen’s war room. It was down the<br/>hall from where, so recently but seemingly so long ago, ’Gina and the<br/>Royal Family had taken tea together. The Queen pretended to read, and<br/>had given ’Gina a book from Albrecht’s collection to distract her. The<br/>Queen’s choice had been random, and she did so without looking at the<br/>title. It was Robert Louis Stevenson’s <b>Kidnapped</b>. Even if the choice<br/>had not been so inapt, ’Gina would still have not been able to read. She<br/>was still distracted by trying to puzzle out the plot. ’Gina started at<br/>every creak that might be the approach of news. She did not think she<br/>was alone in her distraction. Only Hans remained still and apparently<br/>relaxed in his vigilant posture by the door. Mr. Goldthread paced back<br/>and forth, back and forth, behind their chairs, while the Queen never<br/>seemed to move her reading beyond its current page. She idly rotated the<br/>jeweled snake that encircled her wrist.</p><p>Periodically reports did come, but they were always negative. The staff<br/>had sectioned the house into floors and regions of floors into<br/>individual responsibilities. The investigation had begun with those<br/>rooms nearest to the Queen and her family. Staff who dusted looked for<br/>dust where there should be none, and looked for no dust where they knew<br/>there might be some. Valets inspected clothes and their ordering. Where<br/>there stains; spots; blunt creases or pleats? Keys were tried in locks.<br/>Locks were tried without keys. Candles and lamps were lit, and smelled,<br/>and then extinguished. Nothing. Nothing was amiss. The reports came<br/>regularly now, and were always delivered professionally, but there was<br/>some implicit sense of disappointment as the staff’s searches moved away<br/>from the upper floors to the lower reaches, then the question came,<br/>“Sir,” the head butler said addressing Mr. Goldthread, “did you mean to<br/>include the downstairs in your investigations.”</p><p>“I did indeed, and I expect that the investigations will be as thorough<br/>and as diligent and as scrupulous to ANY ANOMALY as they have been<br/>upstairs.”</p><p>“As you wish Sir.” And the black swallowtail coated Head Butler turned<br/>smoothly and elegantly and departed. Hans continued standing, Mr.<br/>Goldthread resumed pacing, and the Queen and ’Gina resumed reading and<br/>re-reading the same pages they had distractedly been reading all the<br/>afternoon.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and it opened to admit Mietzie who began<br/>speaking directly to the Queen. “Mother. I mean Your Majesty. The<br/>younger children are quite exasperating, I mean exasperated by being<br/>kept in their rooms, and with not having had anything to eat since<br/>breakfast, could we now serve tea …” She broke off when she at last<br/>recognized ’Gina. “’Gina!”</p><p>Even as ’Gina felt her muscles tense to spring from her chair and run to<br/>Mietzie she felt the communicative tap-tap of Mr. Goldthread on the back<br/>of her chair. ’Gina then turned with a great effort at self-control<br/>towards the Queen, but before she could begin to ask her permission to<br/>be excused the Queen simply gave a loud sniff in the direction of Mr.<br/>Goldthread, and said to ’Gina afterwards, “Please my dear.” Before the<br/>sentence was complete ’Gina jumped from her chair running to Mietzie.<br/>They met in the middle and knocked themselves to the floor with the<br/>force of their greeting and hugs.</p><p>“Tell me! Tell me!”</p><p>“Tell you what?” Gina asked laughing.</p><p>“Everything! What is the city like? What was school like? Did you make<br/>friends? Better friends? Did you meet any boys?</p><p>“Wait. What is going on? Why are you here? Do you know what is going on<br/>and why the house is locked and searched? ’Gina? Mother?”</p><p>’Gina had not answered any of Mietzie’s questions yet. The two girls sat<br/>cross-legged on the floor and each had an arm slung over the shoulder of<br/>the other. They regarded the Queen from that position.</p><p>The Queen spoke, “’Gina knows the answer to many, maybe all those<br/>questions, but she has not been given leave to speak of them at this<br/>time. Soon though Mietzie,” the Queen had seen Mietzie’s moue. “You make<br/>an excellent suggestion though. Let us go into tea. I am sure the other<br/>children will be happy to see you too ’Gina, and the visiting may help<br/>us try to paint a little happiness on the face of this gloomy day.”</p><p>As all rose to leave the Head Butler presented himself in the doorway.<br/>Mr. Goldthread spoke, “Yes?”</p><p>“We have completed all investigations and found only…, you did say any<br/>anomaly Sir? Well then, we have completed our investigations and survey<br/>and have discovered only one single anomaly. The Queen’s silver is short<br/>one spoon from its inventory of two days ago.”</p><p>“One spoon?” Mr. Goldthread asked. “In the entire household the only<br/>irregularity perceived by any staff member was a single missing spoon?”</p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p>And while Mr. Goldthread grumbled the Head Butler stepped aside and the<br/>Queen led her family to tea.</p><p>On entering the room ’Gina felt a small portion of her wonder and smile<br/>return. This had been the scene of so many happy conversations. True<br/>there had also been trying times in the beginning, but from the<br/>perspective of recent events they did nothing to decrease her<br/>satisfaction on returning. She gathered in hugs and kisses from the<br/>younger children, and the twins begged to see her finger, but she<br/>declined, and they complained that nothing interesting ever happened in<br/>this silly old castle and if it did no one ever let them see it.</p><p>The queen was enjoying her scene of domesticity. It was a slight treat<br/>on a day of great distress and uncertainty. In a spontaneous mood she<br/>dismissed the two maids who customarily served, and turned to ask<br/>Mietzie if she would like to pour? Mietzie was clearly pleased by the<br/>honor. Her mother had never asked her to pour before, had never<br/>entrusted her with the responsibility. ’Gina allowed herself to sink<br/>back slightly in her chair (she did not allow her back to touch the<br/>chair’s back - she did not want another Mr. Goldthread tap), but she did<br/>relax a bit and began to enjoy the sun coming in through the thick<br/>mullioned panes and to feel the breeze come in from outside with the<br/>scents of Spring and the faint twitters of song birds courting. From<br/>this contented posture she saw Mietzie ask Hans if he would like a cup?<br/>Hans declined. Then, having had tea with Mr. Goldthread many times<br/>before, Mietzie began to prepare his cup. ’Gina tensed when she saw<br/>Mietzie pause. ’Gina had begun to have a thought, but as it had not<br/>reached its end yet she was not sure what it meant. She had to wait for<br/>it to finish.</p><p>“What is it Mietzie dear?” The Queen asked.</p><p>“Nothing really Mother. I just thought that there should be tongs for<br/>the sugar. Mr. Goldthread takes two lumps. Oh well, I will just use this<br/>…”</p><p>“STOP!” ’Gina and Hans yelled together. “Stop and do not move!” ’Gina<br/>continued. Silently. Quickly. With Hans at her left shoulder, she moved<br/>towards Mietzie.</p><p>’Gina gazed at the sugar dish Mietzie was holding. ’Gina thought, there<br/>should be sugar tongs here, but there are not. No staff would forget to<br/>put tongs out for tea, and even as ‘Gina thought this she observed the<br/>shiny tiny silver tea spoon of the Queen resting in its place. ’Gina<br/>took the dish from Mietzie and handed it to Hans. She then picked up the<br/>spoon by its end and moved it back and forth in the light. “It is damp.”<br/>Hans said, and ’Gina nodded. Hans took the spoon from her. Their joint<br/>gaze settled on the sugar cubes.</p><p>Hans then took a saucer and the tea pot and poured a small amount of tea<br/>onto the saucer. He then used a different spoon to put three sugar cubes<br/>in the middle of the warm tea sitting in the saucer. Slowly the sugar<br/>began to dissolve into the warm weak tea. As the silent room watched the<br/>boys who complained of nothing interesting ever happening sheltered<br/>themselves by the lee of their mother’s knees. Hans walked the saucer<br/>over to the open window and placed it on the sill. Flies soon buzzed<br/>about they syrup, but before a single one could land, a small goldfinch,<br/>egg yolk yellow in its Spring plumage, landed on the saucer’s edge and<br/>dipped its beak in staccato fashion into the syrup. It stopped, trilled<br/>once, and confusedly flew into the room for a few feet before dropping<br/>unmoving onto the carpet. Mr. Goldthread looked at Hans and said only<br/>“Operation Heimattort.” Hans walked to the door and barked something in<br/>his dialect at the two guards outside. In the meantime the Queen had<br/>stood, gathered her brood, and Hans ushered them out of the door<br/>followed by Mr. Goldthread. Mietzie only had time for one glance back<br/>and a wave, and then ’Gina was left alone in the tea room. No one had<br/>spoken to her. They had all just left.</p><p>’Gina returned to her chair, and allowed herself to slump against the<br/>back. She imagined she could leave. She thought she could leave.<br/>Obviously, with an assassination attempt on the royal family, some<br/>safety plan had been triggered. She did not think it was likely they<br/>would be coming back. But still, she had not been dismissed, and so<br/>’Gina decided to wait a bit. Slowly her body began to slump, and so<br/>slowly she did not realize what was happening there was a flutter of<br/>images, and then she fell asleep. Was that her Mother’s hand stroking<br/>her head? Was that a dream? ’Gina was so tired. So tired. But she had<br/>saved the Queen.</p></root><a href="chapter16">Prior Chapter Flight</a><p><a href="chapter18">Next Chapter Confoederatio Helvetica</a></p></body></html>
