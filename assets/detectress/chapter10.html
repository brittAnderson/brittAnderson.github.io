The room was in the royal family’s quarters nearthe Queen’s chambers. It had no windows. One wall was shelved and theshelves were piled high with loose papers. One wall was bare of shelves.Instead it was plastered with maps. The maps overlapped, and sporadiccolored pins pricked their surfaces and were connected by bright linesof yarn. In one corner stood a table, but there were no chairs aroundit. The table was covered with more maps and papers. Odd metal trinketsshaped like men and horses were positioned about the maps. In the lastwall was a fireplace, currently unlit. In front of the fireplace therewere two facing chairs. Regina observed Albrecht leaning against thewall in one corner. He studied a small pamphlet. In one of the chairsbefore the fireplace Mr. Goldthread sat reading. On seeing Regina enterhe closed his book, and set it to one side. The book came to rest on topof a stack of books that toed in toward the side of his chair. Mr.Goldthread stood and gestured for Regina to sit. As she did so Hans andRené went to stand behind Mr. Goldthread’s shoulders.</p><p>Regina was not used to looking Mr. Goldthread full in the face.Typically he was only a felt presence floating behind her andcommunicating by taps on her chair. Occasionally he was before her, butalways standing just behind and to the side of the Queen. Regina couldnot remember seeing him directly before her - their heads level and eyeslevel. In her nervousness Regina began to idly spin the scaled braceleton her left wrist. Immediately she had the image in her mind of theQueen doing the same. It was a practice Regina had lately seenincreasingly often. Regina immediately felt how heavy must have been theQueen’s burdens. It calmed her, and made her feel more resolved to doher part to help the woman who had done so much to help her, and who hadshown her family such kindness, and on whom rested the responsibilityfor a Nation. At this she stopped twiddling her bracelet. Mr. Goldthreadnoted this; and took it as his opening to speak.</p><p>“You would do well to break that habit, Regina. I have often counseledthe Queen to do the same. Perhaps now that I deduce you understand howmuch is communicated by gesture, phrase, and tone you will find themotivation to practice increasing explicit control. For the Queen her<b>tells</b> cost her only at Whist, but for you in the coming days thestakes could be greater.</p><p>“I will confess to you that I am not in favor of this plan. It is notbecause I do not believe the need is present, or that I doubt yourcapacities, but it is rather because I fear the risk may be greater thanyou, your Mother, and her Majesty conceive. Or it may be that I too havegrown fond of you over these years and now I cannot easily separate myrisk assessments from my protective urges.” He smiled here. “But it hasbeen decided, and so we must prepare.</p><p>“Your cover name will be Janus Kaiserkönig, a niece, by a misty trail,of Xanthippe Kaiserkönig, Duchess of Ost Hinterlandia. As Monsieur Franzhas taught you, there was a dispute over the royal succession severalgenerations ago between the Queen’s Great Grandmother, Elizabeth, andher cousin Mary. There should have been no dispute as the documentationwas quite clear, but the Kaiserkönig line was ambitious. As a result,there has existed a great deal of antipathy between the two branches ofthe family and no Kaiserkönig has visited this city in almost 50 years.Your arrival will therefore attract attention among the aristocratic anddiplomatic sets that send their children to <b>La Grande Ecole Camford</b>,more commonly called ’Phrontisterion Academy’. It is also likely to beassumed that your presence there could indicate some renewed ambition tomake trouble for the Queen. The presumption should be, at the veryleast, that you are unlikely to harbor much affection for the Queen, andso those who may not have the Queen’s better interests in mind may notfeel too inhibited speaking to you. Of course, we will not blamechildren for what they learn at home, but we are relying on them torepeat it to you, and for you to use your deductive talents to concludefrom whom our current difficulties may stem. It is of course entirelylikely that nothing at all will come of this. You will go to school,take classes, learn what you can, and, I hope, enjoy your enhancedopportunities, but we cannot assume that there will not in fact be somemisadventure that could put you at risk, and we also must have a way foryou to communicate to us what you find.</p><p>“It is a fortunate by-product of the hostility of Ost Hinterlandia forall things regal that there is extremely little travel between our twoprovinces, and very little correspondence. So little in fact that only asingle person at the central post office receives and sorts all the mailto and from these two locations. Through him we will be monitoringincoming correspondence, and this person is under orders to forward allmail addressed by you to your patron, Aunt Xanthipe, to us. Of course,no human is perfect. It may be that some day our contact gets his footstepped on by a horse, or eats a bit of bad potato, and has to berelieved in his position. We do not know who might take his place, andeach new person that we involve in our planning raises the risk ofexposure. Therefore, your letters to your Aunt must be written as realletters. They can contain nothing of a local nature that would allowanyone reading them locally to doubt your authenticity. And while anyletter actually passing through to the Duchess will cause confusion ontheir end, there should be nothing in them per se that could alertanyone to their being used as our cover. We are presuming thatHinterlandians are not the ones behind this plot (and we have alternatesources of intelligence that make this likely) so they should have noreason to be urgent in resolving the identity of this poseur trickingthe Queen’s friends. In fact, we suspect that they would enjoy thispotential embarrassment and are likely to play along. Thus, you mustwrite to your Aunt regularly. We will read all your letters. If one getsthrough it must seem innocuous to anyone reading it in Ost Hinterlandia.Do you understand?”</p><p>Regina’s response was a simple yes.</p><p>“You are wondering how it is we will know how to communicate? If youwish to communicate with me or one of the household you are to includein your letter a complaint that you are homesick, and ask to be allowedto make a visit home. We will interpret this as meaning that you havesome information, but that it is not of the sort that jeopardizes yourposition in the school. We will arrange for a carriage bearing the OstHinterlandia coat of arms to pick you up and take you out of the city.We will arrange for the carriage to detour to an alternate locationwhere we can talk freely. Then in a day or two you will return to schoolto resume your investigations. If you feel you need to be removed fromthe school permanently, because you have a good idea who is behind theplot or because you perceive yourself to be at personal risk, you willwrite to your Aunt that you are sick with a fever. Confine yourself toyour room then, as much as you can, and wait for the “doctor” to come toyou. That will be our man and he will arrange for your transport to aclinic, which will, in fact, be here at the castle. Of course, these twomethods still involve significant delays. You can, if need be, simplywalk out of the school and into the nearest police station and speak tothe duty Sergeant. Tell him it is urgent that you speak to William Tell.He will ask you why, and you will say it is because you have an apple onyour head. I know this sounds silly, but it has been disseminated as aspecific emergency code to all precincts and they will immediatelycontact our Swiss friends here. As a last resort it may be possible thatyou cannot wait on a letter, but do not feel safe to move about freelyin the school or the city. I cannot imagine what eventuality shouldcause such a restriction, but I do not rely on my imagination todetermine the extent of my contingency plans. Should such an eventtranspire place a white x in your window. Make it of tape or cloth, orwhatever comes to hand. We will see it - and it is perhaps best if youdo not know too much about how it is that we will see it - and we willput in place our plans for your immediate removal. If you feel youunderstand, please repeat back to me the salient facts of your coverstory, and the messaging protocols we have put in place.”</p><p>Regina repeated succinctly the core features. She saw Albrecht in hiscorner pretending to read but listening instead. She had seen that hispamphlet was upside down. She glanced at the faces of the two Swissguards who remained calm and impassive, but neither of whom met hergaze. Lastly, she stared back at Mr. Goldthread who idly fiddled withthe chain of his pocket watch where it hung from a waistcoat pocket. Agesture she hoped to one day tell the Queen about in hopes of it eveningthe odds at Whist. When she had finished her recitation she received oneof Mr. Goldthread’s micro-expressions of approval: he stopped fiddlingwith his watch chain. She then asked, “When is it that I leave?”</p><p>“Tonight,” Herr Gafner replied. “It is important that anyoneinvestigating your arrival should find evidence of your travels. We willleave by mail coach for the Ost Hinterlandian border. Shortly before weget there we will transfer to a different coach that we have decoratedwith the Hinterlandian court insignia. Anyone working there way backfrom your arrival will be informed of the Duchess’s coach’s transit.They should have no reason to doubt that your are who you say you are.”</p><p>“And if you think someone might,” Herr Stoll added “simply invite themto tea.” And the two Swiss gentleman smiled at her, and she could seethe puzzlement on Albrecht’s face in the background. Mr. Goldthread musthave sensed it too, because he immediately interjected. “PrinceAlbrecht. Would you be so kind as to see to that matter about thestables that we discussed,” and to Regina “My dear. I think now is thetime to take leave of your Mother. In an hour you need to be in thekitchen. We will leave the property by some less used routes.”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Albrecht was indeed puzzled by the Swiss Guards statement that Regina’sbest defense lay in a well laid tea table, but he knew that there wasmuch that was not being said. As he strode across the lawns and fieldstowards the stable, Albrecht did not try to solve that puzzle so much asanother. Why he wondered was there even a need for such secrecy withinthe Royal household itself? That need seemed to indicate that Mr.Goldthread feared that information was leaking from the householditself. He knew he and his siblings tended to prattle on. That was howRegina had deduced a threat, but how could anyone make use of thatinformation? They could only do so if someone else in the household wascollecting information and communicating it outside. The Swiss and Mr.Goldthread were completely trustworthy. Monsieur Franz was beyondrepute, but what about the rest of the staff. Most were the children orrelatives of staff from generations before. Few even left the grounds,but then again some did. Their responsibilities required it. Food camein. Missions were sent out. Albrecht slowed his step when he saw thestable lights loom large. He now felt chilled. There was a threat to hisfamily and his country. He did not know what information had beenpurloined from his Mother, but he could not escape the conclusion thatthere was a spy in the household, and he wondered if it was someone heknew? Someone he trusted? The sense of risk and exposure made him feelangry and then afraid for his family. Before he had been worried forRegina’s safety alone, but now he worried for them all.</p><p>Albrecht entered the stables to find Willie sitting near the front witha small skillet heating over a small manure fire. Willie stood up andbowed on Albrecht’s entry, but did not wait to be excused before sittingback down by his dinner fire. He and the Prince were long acquainted,and they had developed their own pattern of trust and acknowledgment.“Would you like a bit to eat your Highness? It’s a rabbit one of thewardens give me. Tasty, and the smoke from the fire don’t affect thetaste, much.”</p><p>“No, thank you Willie.” Albrecht pulled up a farrier’s stool that layagainst the wall, and sat in silence for awhile by the fire. Williesimply watched him while he ate. Willie seemed to catch the seriousmood, and he doused the fire putting his pan and its uneaten rabbit tothe side. Then he simply sat, and waited for the Prince to speak.</p><p>“Willie. I need you to do something for me, as your Prince.”</p><p>“You’re always my Prince, your Highness. Whatever you want.”</p><p>“No Willie. I have always been Prince Albrecht, an older boy that yougive a bow to, and then go about your business. An older boy who likesto ride and likes horses too, and who doesn’t make you do too muchscraping, and who likes you to speak freely. Now I need you to dosomething for me as your ’Prince.’ A command that you will obey, becauseI have given it. Without dissent. Without question. And without failure.Of course I can make such a command. But I need to know if you can doit?”</p><p>“I like you your Highness. You and the family has always been square byme. I had no place to go, and nothing to do, and now I eat regular, staywarm mostly, and get to spend my time with horses, which I love. I amalways grateful. But I think I get what you mean. You’re going to askfor something more, and I got to decide before knowing what it iswhether I can say I will do it.”</p><p>There was a nod from Albrecht.</p><p>“You know. I’ve seen you ride Albrecht. You push your horses hard, butyou never brought one back lathered or with a whip mark. You’ve made meshovel until I was sore, but you never asked me more than I can do. Justa couple of weeks ago you brought your sister here and you treated herhard too, but it seemed to be something she needed, and she didn’ seemto bear you no ill, and though I treated her kind o’harsh, you did’nt doanything to me on account that you knew that I didn’t know. That seemedfair. I guess what I mean is that even when you ask someone to dosomething you don’t seem to ask them to do more than they can do, andyou treat them fair whether they succeed or fail. I guess I can agree.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. But remember that hunt with Whispering Wind, thatjust broken colt. I rode him hard, and he snapped a leg, and we had toput him down.”</p><p>“Yeah, but that weren’t your fault. You couldn’t seen that hole on theother side of the fence. Everyone said so, and I asked all the grooms.No one said anything against you.” Willie paused, and seemed to reflectbefore going on. “Oh. I see. Just because you’re fair don’t mean you canguarantee it’s going to go alright.” Another pause, and Willie poked atthe ashes of his cook fire with a stick. “Yes your Highness.” Willie gotup from his squat, went down on one knee and bowed his head. “I will doas you command.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. Please take your seat again. I need you to take myhorse Vanguard to the central stables in the city.”</p><p>Willie’s eye grew wide. “That’s all I got to do? That didn’t need thatspeech. I like going to the city. I been there twice you know. When youwant the horse there. I can tell Stable Master first thing in themorning, and it will be there by noon.”</p><p>“No Willie. No Stable Master, and I need you to go now.”</p><p>“But if I don’t tell the Stable Master he’ll think I run off and stolethe horse. I could get whipped or worse if they catch me.”</p><p>“No Stable Master, Willie. And I need you to go now.”</p><p>Willie looked at Albrecht. Albrecht’s expression was flat, his voicesounded determined, important.</p><p>“I guess I should’ve know’d it wasn’t going to be that simple. How do Iget them to take me and the horse at the stable?”</p><p>“Tell them William Tell sent you. Say it. Who sent you? … Good. Tellthem William Tell sent you. You will be given a stable for the horsewith provisions of hay, and whatever they can scrounge for you. You willreceive a message telling you to watch a window in a particularbuilding. You will either be watching that window or tending to myhorse. You will not tour the city. You will not look at the shops. Youwill not dream, or idle, or wander or walk. You will not sleep except asneeded to be able to watch that window. Do you understand? … Good. Andif someone catches you on my horse before you get there you admit tostealing it. No excuses. No telling of this story. You must trust thatsomeone will come and get me, and that I will treat you as fair as Ican.”</p><p>Willie stood. He seemed taller. He began to nod, but then stoppedhimself. “Yes. Your Highness. As you command.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht stood now too. “You are to watch that window for a white‘X’. It may be tape. It may be cloth. It might be something else, but ifyou see that white X you get my horse and you come to me at all speed. Idon’t care if you kill that horse riding it into the ground, you are toget to me, and me alone, as fast as you can. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes. Your Highness.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht reached out to rest a hand on Willie’s shoulder. “I willnot forget this William. I will repay your service and trust when I can.Now on your way. I will stay until you are off, and then you are on own.Godspeed. And Long Live the Queen.”</p><p>Willie had never been called William before. He wasn’t even sure thatWilliam was his name. He had only ever been called Willie as far as hecould remember, but the Prince’s words made him proud, and made himswear to himself that he would not fail. “God save the Queen.” Williamrepeated softly, and then without waiting to be dismissed, he grabbedthe Prince’s saddle off its hook and went into Vanguard’s stable. Inless than five minutes Willie was leading the horse outside, where ahalf-moon provided sufficient light to see a dirt track leading offbetween tended fields. Prince Albrecht remained in the stables with hishead bowed and eyes closed. He listened to hoof beats fade away, andwhen they were gone he repeated softly one more time, “I will notforget. God save the Queen.” Then Albrecht slowly made his way back tothe castle noting that he felt very much older than when he had awakenedthat morning.</p></root><a href="chapter9.html">Prior Chapter Self-Defense</a><p><a href="chapter11.html">Next Chapter Schooled</a></p></body></html>
