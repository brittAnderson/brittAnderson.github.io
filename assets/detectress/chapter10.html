The room was in the royal family’s quarters near<br/>the Queen’s chambers. It had no windows. One wall was shelved and the<br/>shelves were piled high with loose papers. One wall was bare of shelves.<br/>Instead it was plastered with maps. The maps overlapped, and sporadic<br/>colored pins pricked their surfaces and were connected by bright lines<br/>of yarn. In one corner stood a table, but there were no chairs around<br/>it. The table was covered with more maps and papers. Odd metal trinkets<br/>shaped like men and horses were positioned about the maps. In the last<br/>wall was a fireplace, currently unlit. In front of the fireplace there<br/>were two facing chairs. Regina observed Albrecht leaning against the<br/>wall in one corner. He studied a small pamphlet. In one of the chairs<br/>before the fireplace Mr. Goldthread sat reading. On seeing Regina enter<br/>he closed his book, and set it to one side. The book came to rest on top<br/>of a stack of books that toed in toward the side of his chair. Mr.<br/>Goldthread stood and gestured for Regina to sit. As she did so Hans and<br/>René went to stand behind Mr. Goldthread’s shoulders.</p><p>Regina was not used to looking Mr. Goldthread full in the face.<br/>Typically he was only a felt presence floating behind her and<br/>communicating by taps on her chair. Occasionally he was before her, but<br/>always standing just behind and to the side of the Queen. Regina could<br/>not remember seeing him directly before her - their heads level and eyes<br/>level. In her nervousness Regina began to idly spin the scaled bracelet<br/>on her left wrist. Immediately she had the image in her mind of the<br/>Queen doing the same. It was a practice Regina had lately seen<br/>increasingly often. Regina immediately felt how heavy must have been the<br/>Queen’s burdens. It calmed her, and made her feel more resolved to do<br/>her part to help the woman who had done so much to help her, and who had<br/>shown her family such kindness, and on whom rested the responsibility<br/>for a Nation. At this she stopped twiddling her bracelet. Mr. Goldthread<br/>noted this; and took it as his opening to speak.</p><p>“You would do well to break that habit, Regina. I have often counseled<br/>the Queen to do the same. Perhaps now that I deduce you understand how<br/>much is communicated by gesture, phrase, and tone you will find the<br/>motivation to practice increasing explicit control. For the Queen her<br/><b>tells</b> cost her only at Whist, but for you in the coming days the<br/>stakes could be greater.</p><p>“I will confess to you that I am not in favor of this plan. It is not<br/>because I do not believe the need is present, or that I doubt your<br/>capacities, but it is rather because I fear the risk may be greater than<br/>you, your Mother, and her Majesty conceive. Or it may be that I too have<br/>grown fond of you over these years and now I cannot easily separate my<br/>risk assessments from my protective urges.” He smiled here. “But it has<br/>been decided, and so we must prepare.</p><p>“Your cover name will be Janus Kaiserkönig, a niece, by a misty trail,<br/>of Xanthippe Kaiserkönig, Duchess of Ost Hinterlandia. As Monsieur Franz<br/>has taught you, there was a dispute over the royal succession several<br/>generations ago between the Queen’s Great Grandmother, Elizabeth, and<br/>her cousin Mary. There should have been no dispute as the documentation<br/>was quite clear, but the Kaiserkönig line was ambitious. As a result,<br/>there has existed a great deal of antipathy between the two branches of<br/>the family and no Kaiserkönig has visited this city in almost 50 years.<br/>Your arrival will therefore attract attention among the aristocratic and<br/>diplomatic sets that send their children to <b>La Grande Ecole Camford</b>,<br/>more commonly called ’Phrontisterion Academy’. It is also likely to be<br/>assumed that your presence there could indicate some renewed ambition to<br/>make trouble for the Queen. The presumption should be, at the very<br/>least, that you are unlikely to harbor much affection for the Queen, and<br/>so those who may not have the Queen’s better interests in mind may not<br/>feel too inhibited speaking to you. Of course, we will not blame<br/>children for what they learn at home, but we are relying on them to<br/>repeat it to you, and for you to use your deductive talents to conclude<br/>from whom our current difficulties may stem. It is of course entirely<br/>likely that nothing at all will come of this. You will go to school,<br/>take classes, learn what you can, and, I hope, enjoy your enhanced<br/>opportunities, but we cannot assume that there will not in fact be some<br/>misadventure that could put you at risk, and we also must have a way for<br/>you to communicate to us what you find.</p><p>“It is a fortunate by-product of the hostility of Ost Hinterlandia for<br/>all things regal that there is extremely little travel between our two<br/>provinces, and very little correspondence. So little in fact that only a<br/>single person at the central post office receives and sorts all the mail<br/>to and from these two locations. Through him we will be monitoring<br/>incoming correspondence, and this person is under orders to forward all<br/>mail addressed by you to your patron, Aunt Xanthipe, to us. Of course,<br/>no human is perfect. It may be that some day our contact gets his foot<br/>stepped on by a horse, or eats a bit of bad potato, and has to be<br/>relieved in his position. We do not know who might take his place, and<br/>each new person that we involve in our planning raises the risk of<br/>exposure. Therefore, your letters to your Aunt must be written as real<br/>letters. They can contain nothing of a local nature that would allow<br/>anyone reading them locally to doubt your authenticity. And while any<br/>letter actually passing through to the Duchess will cause confusion on<br/>their end, there should be nothing in them per se that could alert<br/>anyone to their being used as our cover. We are presuming that<br/>Hinterlandians are not the ones behind this plot (and we have alternate<br/>sources of intelligence that make this likely) so they should have no<br/>reason to be urgent in resolving the identity of this poseur tricking<br/>the Queen’s friends. In fact, we suspect that they would enjoy this<br/>potential embarrassment and are likely to play along. Thus, you must<br/>write to your Aunt regularly. We will read all your letters. If one gets<br/>through it must seem innocuous to anyone reading it in Ost Hinterlandia.<br/>Do you understand?”</p><p>Regina’s response was a simple yes.</p><p>“You are wondering how it is we will know how to communicate? If you<br/>wish to communicate with me or one of the household you are to include<br/>in your letter a complaint that you are homesick, and ask to be allowed<br/>to make a visit home. We will interpret this as meaning that you have<br/>some information, but that it is not of the sort that jeopardizes your<br/>position in the school. We will arrange for a carriage bearing the Ost<br/>Hinterlandia coat of arms to pick you up and take you out of the city.<br/>We will arrange for the carriage to detour to an alternate location<br/>where we can talk freely. Then in a day or two you will return to school<br/>to resume your investigations. If you feel you need to be removed from<br/>the school permanently, because you have a good idea who is behind the<br/>plot or because you perceive yourself to be at personal risk, you will<br/>write to your Aunt that you are sick with a fever. Confine yourself to<br/>your room then, as much as you can, and wait for the “doctor” to come to<br/>you. That will be our man and he will arrange for your transport to a<br/>clinic, which will, in fact, be here at the castle. Of course, these two<br/>methods still involve significant delays. You can, if need be, simply<br/>walk out of the school and into the nearest police station and speak to<br/>the duty Sergeant. Tell him it is urgent that you speak to William Tell.<br/>He will ask you why, and you will say it is because you have an apple on<br/>your head. I know this sounds silly, but it has been disseminated as a<br/>specific emergency code to all precincts and they will immediately<br/>contact our Swiss friends here. As a last resort it may be possible that<br/>you cannot wait on a letter, but do not feel safe to move about freely<br/>in the school or the city. I cannot imagine what eventuality should<br/>cause such a restriction, but I do not rely on my imagination to<br/>determine the extent of my contingency plans. Should such an event<br/>transpire place a white x in your window. Make it of tape or cloth, or<br/>whatever comes to hand. We will see it - and it is perhaps best if you<br/>do not know too much about how it is that we will see it - and we will<br/>put in place our plans for your immediate removal. If you feel you<br/>understand, please repeat back to me the salient facts of your cover<br/>story, and the messaging protocols we have put in place.”</p><p>Regina repeated succinctly the core features. She saw Albrecht in his<br/>corner pretending to read but listening instead. She had seen that his<br/>pamphlet was upside down. She glanced at the faces of the two Swiss<br/>guards who remained calm and impassive, but neither of whom met her<br/>gaze. Lastly, she stared back at Mr. Goldthread who idly fiddled with<br/>the chain of his pocket watch where it hung from a waistcoat pocket. A<br/>gesture she hoped to one day tell the Queen about in hopes of it evening<br/>the odds at Whist. When she had finished her recitation she received one<br/>of Mr. Goldthread’s micro-expressions of approval: he stopped fiddling<br/>with his watch chain. She then asked, “When is it that I leave?”</p><p>“Tonight,” Herr Gafner replied. “It is important that anyone<br/>investigating your arrival should find evidence of your travels. We will<br/>leave by mail coach for the Ost Hinterlandian border. Shortly before we<br/>get there we will transfer to a different coach that we have decorated<br/>with the Hinterlandian court insignia. Anyone working there way back<br/>from your arrival will be informed of the Duchess’s coach’s transit.<br/>They should have no reason to doubt that your are who you say you are.”</p><p>“And if you think someone might,” Herr Stoll added “simply invite them<br/>to tea.” And the two Swiss gentleman smiled at her, and she could see<br/>the puzzlement on Albrecht’s face in the background. Mr. Goldthread must<br/>have sensed it too, because he immediately interjected. “Prince<br/>Albrecht. Would you be so kind as to see to that matter about the<br/>stables that we discussed,” and to Regina “My dear. I think now is the<br/>time to take leave of your Mother. In an hour you need to be in the<br/>kitchen. We will leave the property by some less used routes.”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Albrecht was indeed puzzled by the Swiss Guards statement that Regina’s<br/>best defense lay in a well laid tea table, but he knew that there was<br/>much that was not being said. As he strode across the lawns and fields<br/>towards the stable, Albrecht did not try to solve that puzzle so much as<br/>another. Why he wondered was there even a need for such secrecy within<br/>the Royal household itself? That need seemed to indicate that Mr.<br/>Goldthread feared that information was leaking from the household<br/>itself. He knew he and his siblings tended to prattle on. That was how<br/>Regina had deduced a threat, but how could anyone make use of that<br/>information? They could only do so if someone else in the household was<br/>collecting information and communicating it outside. The Swiss and Mr.<br/>Goldthread were completely trustworthy. Monsieur Franz was beyond<br/>repute, but what about the rest of the staff. Most were the children or<br/>relatives of staff from generations before. Few even left the grounds,<br/>but then again some did. Their responsibilities required it. Food came<br/>in. Missions were sent out. Albrecht slowed his step when he saw the<br/>stable lights loom large. He now felt chilled. There was a threat to his<br/>family and his country. He did not know what information had been<br/>purloined from his Mother, but he could not escape the conclusion that<br/>there was a spy in the household, and he wondered if it was someone he<br/>knew? Someone he trusted? The sense of risk and exposure made him feel<br/>angry and then afraid for his family. Before he had been worried for<br/>Regina’s safety alone, but now he worried for them all.</p><p>Albrecht entered the stables to find Willie sitting near the front with<br/>a small skillet heating over a small manure fire. Willie stood up and<br/>bowed on Albrecht’s entry, but did not wait to be excused before sitting<br/>back down by his dinner fire. He and the Prince were long acquainted,<br/>and they had developed their own pattern of trust and acknowledgment.<br/>“Would you like a bit to eat your Highness? It’s a rabbit one of the<br/>wardens give me. Tasty, and the smoke from the fire don’t affect the<br/>taste, much.”</p><p>“No, thank you Willie.” Albrecht pulled up a farrier’s stool that lay<br/>against the wall, and sat in silence for awhile by the fire. Willie<br/>simply watched him while he ate. Willie seemed to catch the serious<br/>mood, and he doused the fire putting his pan and its uneaten rabbit to<br/>the side. Then he simply sat, and waited for the Prince to speak.</p><p>“Willie. I need you to do something for me, as your Prince.”</p><p>“You’re always my Prince, your Highness. Whatever you want.”</p><p>“No Willie. I have always been Prince Albrecht, an older boy that you<br/>give a bow to, and then go about your business. An older boy who likes<br/>to ride and likes horses too, and who doesn’t make you do too much<br/>scraping, and who likes you to speak freely. Now I need you to do<br/>something for me as your ’Prince.’ A command that you will obey, because<br/>I have given it. Without dissent. Without question. And without failure.<br/>Of course I can make such a command. But I need to know if you can do<br/>it?”</p><p>“I like you your Highness. You and the family has always been square by<br/>me. I had no place to go, and nothing to do, and now I eat regular, stay<br/>warm mostly, and get to spend my time with horses, which I love. I am<br/>always grateful. But I think I get what you mean. You’re going to ask<br/>for something more, and I got to decide before knowing what it is<br/>whether I can say I will do it.”</p><p>There was a nod from Albrecht.</p><p>“You know. I’ve seen you ride Albrecht. You push your horses hard, but<br/>you never brought one back lathered or with a whip mark. You’ve made me<br/>shovel until I was sore, but you never asked me more than I can do. Just<br/>a couple of weeks ago you brought your sister here and you treated her<br/>hard too, but it seemed to be something she needed, and she didn’ seem<br/>to bear you no ill, and though I treated her kind o’harsh, you did’nt do<br/>anything to me on account that you knew that I didn’t know. That seemed<br/>fair. I guess what I mean is that even when you ask someone to do<br/>something you don’t seem to ask them to do more than they can do, and<br/>you treat them fair whether they succeed or fail. I guess I can agree.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. But remember that hunt with Whispering Wind, that<br/>just broken colt. I rode him hard, and he snapped a leg, and we had to<br/>put him down.”</p><p>“Yeah, but that weren’t your fault. You couldn’t seen that hole on the<br/>other side of the fence. Everyone said so, and I asked all the grooms.<br/>No one said anything against you.” Willie paused, and seemed to reflect<br/>before going on. “Oh. I see. Just because you’re fair don’t mean you can<br/>guarantee it’s going to go alright.” Another pause, and Willie poked at<br/>the ashes of his cook fire with a stick. “Yes your Highness.” Willie got<br/>up from his squat, went down on one knee and bowed his head. “I will do<br/>as you command.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. Please take your seat again. I need you to take my<br/>horse Vanguard to the central stables in the city.”</p><p>Willie’s eye grew wide. “That’s all I got to do? That didn’t need that<br/>speech. I like going to the city. I been there twice you know. When you<br/>want the horse there. I can tell Stable Master first thing in the<br/>morning, and it will be there by noon.”</p><p>“No Willie. No Stable Master, and I need you to go now.”</p><p>“But if I don’t tell the Stable Master he’ll think I run off and stole<br/>the horse. I could get whipped or worse if they catch me.”</p><p>“No Stable Master, Willie. And I need you to go now.”</p><p>Willie looked at Albrecht. Albrecht’s expression was flat, his voice<br/>sounded determined, important.</p><p>“I guess I should’ve know’d it wasn’t going to be that simple. How do I<br/>get them to take me and the horse at the stable?”</p><p>“Tell them William Tell sent you. Say it. Who sent you? … Good. Tell<br/>them William Tell sent you. You will be given a stable for the horse<br/>with provisions of hay, and whatever they can scrounge for you. You will<br/>receive a message telling you to watch a window in a particular<br/>building. You will either be watching that window or tending to my<br/>horse. You will not tour the city. You will not look at the shops. You<br/>will not dream, or idle, or wander or walk. You will not sleep except as<br/>needed to be able to watch that window. Do you understand? … Good. And<br/>if someone catches you on my horse before you get there you admit to<br/>stealing it. No excuses. No telling of this story. You must trust that<br/>someone will come and get me, and that I will treat you as fair as I<br/>can.”</p><p>Willie stood. He seemed taller. He began to nod, but then stopped<br/>himself. “Yes. Your Highness. As you command.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht stood now too. “You are to watch that window for a white<br/>‘X’. It may be tape. It may be cloth. It might be something else, but if<br/>you see that white X you get my horse and you come to me at all speed. I<br/>don’t care if you kill that horse riding it into the ground, you are to<br/>get to me, and me alone, as fast as you can. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes. Your Highness.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht reached out to rest a hand on Willie’s shoulder. “I will<br/>not forget this William. I will repay your service and trust when I can.<br/>Now on your way. I will stay until you are off, and then you are on own.<br/>Godspeed. And Long Live the Queen.”</p><p>Willie had never been called William before. He wasn’t even sure that<br/>William was his name. He had only ever been called Willie as far as he<br/>could remember, but the Prince’s words made him proud, and made him<br/>swear to himself that he would not fail. “God save the Queen.” William<br/>repeated softly, and then without waiting to be dismissed, he grabbed<br/>the Prince’s saddle off its hook and went into Vanguard’s stable. In<br/>less than five minutes Willie was leading the horse outside, where a<br/>half-moon provided sufficient light to see a dirt track leading off<br/>between tended fields. Prince Albrecht remained in the stables with his<br/>head bowed and eyes closed. He listened to hoof beats fade away, and<br/>when they were gone he repeated softly one more time, “I will not<br/>forget. God save the Queen.” Then Albrecht slowly made his way back to<br/>the castle noting that he felt very much older than when he had awakened<br/>that morning.</p></root><a href="chapter9.html">Prior Chapter Self-Defense</a><p><a href="chapter11.html">Next Chapter Schooled</a></p></body></html>
