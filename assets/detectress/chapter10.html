The room was in the royal family’s quarters near the Queen’s chambers. It had no windows. One wall was shelved and the shelves were piled high with loose papers. One wall was bare of shelves. Instead it was plastered with maps. The maps overlapped, and sporadic colored pins pricked their surfaces and were connected by bright lines of yarn. In one corner stood a table, but there were no chairs around it. The table was covered with more maps and papers. Odd metal trinkets shaped like men and horses were positioned about the maps. In the last wall was a fireplace, currently unlit. In front of the fireplace there were two facing chairs. Regina observed Albrecht leaning against the wall in one corner. He studied a small pamphlet. In one of the chairs before the fireplace Mr. Goldthread sat reading. On seeing Regina enter he closed his book, and set it to one side. The book came to rest on top of a stack of books that toed in toward the side of his chair. Mr. Goldthread stood and gestured for Regina to sit. As she did so Hans and René went to stand behind Mr. Goldthread’s shoulders.</p><p>Regina was not used to looking Mr. Goldthread full in the face. Typically he was only a felt presence floating behind her and communicating by taps on her chair. Occasionally he was before her, but always standing just behind and to the side of the Queen. Regina could not remember seeing him directly before her - their heads level and eyes level. In her nervousness Regina began to idly spin the scaled bracelet on her left wrist. Immediately she had the image in her mind of the Queen doing the same. It was a practice Regina had lately seen increasingly often. Regina immediately felt how heavy must have been the Queen’s burdens. It calmed her, and made her feel more resolved to do her part to help the woman who had done so much to help her, and who had shown her family such kindness, and on whom rested the responsibility for a Nation. At this she stopped twiddling her bracelet. Mr. Goldthread noted this; and took it as his opening to speak.</p><p>“You would do well to break that habit, Regina. I have often counseled the Queen to do the same. Perhaps now that I deduce you understand how much is communicated by gesture, phrase, and tone you will find the motivation to practice increasing explicit control. For the Queen her <b>tells</b> cost her only at Whist, but for you in the coming days the stakes could be greater.</p><p>“I will confess to you that I am not in favor of this plan. It is not because I do not believe the need is present, or that I doubt your capacities, but it is rather because I fear the risk may be greater than you, your Mother, and her Majesty conceive. Or it may be that I too have grown fond of you over these years and now I cannot easily separate my risk assessments from my protective urges.” He smiled here. “But it has been decided, and so we must prepare.</p><p>“Your cover name will be Janus Kaiserkönig, a niece, by a misty trail, of Xanthippe Kaiserkönig, Duchess of Ost Hinterlandia. As Monsieur Franz has taught you, there was a dispute over the royal succession several generations ago between the Queen’s Great Grandmother, Elizabeth, and her cousin Mary. There should have been no dispute as the documentation was quite clear, but the Kaiserkönig line was ambitious. As a result, there has existed a great deal of antipathy between the two branches of the family and no Kaiserkönig has visited this city in almost 50 years. Your arrival will therefore attract attention among the aristocratic and diplomatic sets that send their children to <b>La Grande Ecole Camford</b>, more commonly called ’Phrontisterion Academy’. It is also likely to be assumed that your presence there could indicate some renewed ambition to make trouble for the Queen. The presumption should be, at the very least, that you are unlikely to harbor much affection for the Queen, and so those who may not have the Queen’s better interests in mind may not feel too inhibited speaking to you. Of course, we will not blame children for what they learn at home, but we are relying on them to repeat it to you, and for you to use your deductive talents to conclude from whom our current difficulties may stem. It is of course entirely likely that nothing at all will come of this. You will go to school, take classes, learn what you can, and, I hope, enjoy your enhanced opportunities, but we cannot assume that there will not in fact be some misadventure that could put you at risk, and we also must have a way for you to communicate to us what you find.</p><p>“It is a fortunate by-product of the hostility of Ost Hinterlandia for all things regal that there is extremely little travel between our two provinces, and very little correspondence. So little in fact that only a single person at the central post office receives and sorts all the mail to and from these two locations. Through him we will be monitoring incoming correspondence, and this person is under orders to forward all mail addressed by you to your patron, Aunt Xanthipe, to us. Of course, no human is perfect. It may be that some day our contact gets his foot stepped on by a horse, or eats a bit of bad potato, and has to be relieved in his position. We do not know who might take his place, and each new person that we involve in our planning raises the risk of exposure. Therefore, your letters to your Aunt must be written as real letters. They can contain nothing of a local nature that would allow anyone reading them locally to doubt your authenticity. And while any letter actually passing through to the Duchess will cause confusion on their end, there should be nothing in them per se that could alert anyone to their being used as our cover. We are presuming that Hinterlandians are not the ones behind this plot (and we have alternate sources of intelligence that make this likely) so they should have no reason to be urgent in resolving the identity of this poseur tricking the Queen’s friends. In fact, we suspect that they would enjoy this potential embarrassment and are likely to play along. Thus, you must write to your Aunt regularly. We will read all your letters. If one gets through it must seem innocuous to anyone reading it in Ost Hinterlandia. Do you understand?”</p><p>Regina’s response was a simple yes.</p><p>“You are wondering how it is we will know how to communicate? If you wish to communicate with me or one of the household you are to include in your letter a complaint that you are homesick, and ask to be allowed to make a visit home. We will interpret this as meaning that you have some information, but that it is not of the sort that jeopardizes your position in the school. We will arrange for a carriage bearing the Ost Hinterlandia coat of arms to pick you up and take you out of the city. We will arrange for the carriage to detour to an alternate location where we can talk freely. Then in a day or two you will return to school to resume your investigations. If you feel you need to be removed from the school permanently, because you have a good idea who is behind the plot or because you perceive yourself to be at personal risk, you will write to your Aunt that you are sick with a fever. Confine yourself to your room then, as much as you can, and wait for the “doctor” to come to you. That will be our man and he will arrange for your transport to a clinic, which will, in fact, be here at the castle. Of course, these two methods still involve significant delays. You can, if need be, simply walk out of the school and into the nearest police station and speak to the duty Sergeant. Tell him it is urgent that you speak to William Tell. He will ask you why, and you will say it is because you have an apple on your head. I know this sounds silly, but it has been disseminated as a specific emergency code to all precincts and they will immediately contact our Swiss friends here. As a last resort it may be possible that you cannot wait on a letter, but do not feel safe to move about freely in the school or the city. I cannot imagine what eventuality should cause such a restriction, but I do not rely on my imagination to determine the extent of my contingency plans. Should such an event transpire place a white x in your window. Make it of tape or cloth, or whatever comes to hand. We will see it - and it is perhaps best if you do not know too much about how it is that we will see it - and we will put in place our plans for your immediate removal. If you feel you understand, please repeat back to me the salient facts of your cover story, and the messaging protocols we have put in place.”</p><p>Regina repeated succinctly the core features. She saw Albrecht in his corner pretending to read but listening instead. She had seen that his pamphlet was upside down. She glanced at the faces of the two Swiss guards who remained calm and impassive, but neither of whom met her gaze. Lastly, she stared back at Mr. Goldthread who idly fiddled with the chain of his pocket watch where it hung from a waistcoat pocket. A gesture she hoped to one day tell the Queen about in hopes of it evening the odds at Whist. When she had finished her recitation she received one of Mr. Goldthread’s micro-expressions of approval: he stopped fiddling with his watch chain. She then asked, “When is it that I leave?”</p><p>“Tonight,” Herr Gafner replied. “It is important that anyone investigating your arrival should find evidence of your travels. We will leave by mail coach for the Ost Hinterlandian border. Shortly before we get there we will transfer to a different coach that we have decorated with the Hinterlandian court insignia. Anyone working there way back from your arrival will be informed of the Duchess’s coach’s transit. They should have no reason to doubt that your are who you say you are.”</p><p>“And if you think someone might,” Herr Stoll added “simply invite them to tea.” And the two Swiss gentleman smiled at her, and she could see the puzzlement on Albrecht’s face in the background. Mr. Goldthread must have sensed it too, because he immediately interjected. “Prince Albrecht. Would you be so kind as to see to that matter about the stables that we discussed,” and to Regina “My dear. I think now is the time to take leave of your Mother. In an hour you need to be in the kitchen. We will leave the property by some less used routes.”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Albrecht was indeed puzzled by the Swiss Guards statement that Regina’s best defense lay in a well laid tea table, but he knew that there was much that was not being said. As he strode across the lawns and fields towards the stable, Albrecht did not try to solve that puzzle so much as another. Why he wondered was there even a need for such secrecy within the Royal household itself? That need seemed to indicate that Mr. Goldthread feared that information was leaking from the household itself. He knew he and his siblings tended to prattle on. That was how Regina had deduced a threat, but how could anyone make use of that information? They could only do so if someone else in the household was collecting information and communicating it outside. The Swiss and Mr. Goldthread were completely trustworthy. Monsieur Franz was beyond repute, but what about the rest of the staff. Most were the children or relatives of staff from generations before. Few even left the grounds, but then again some did. Their responsibilities required it. Food came in. Missions were sent out. Albrecht slowed his step when he saw the stable lights loom large. He now felt chilled. There was a threat to his family and his country. He did not know what information had been purloined from his Mother, but he could not escape the conclusion that there was a spy in the household, and he wondered if it was someone he knew? Someone he trusted? The sense of risk and exposure made him feel angry and then afraid for his family. Before he had been worried for Regina’s safety alone, but now he worried for them all.</p><p>Albrecht entered the stables to find Willie sitting near the front with a small skillet heating over a small manure fire. Willie stood up and bowed on Albrecht’s entry, but did not wait to be excused before sitting back down by his dinner fire. He and the Prince were long acquainted, and they had developed their own pattern of trust and acknowledgment. “Would you like a bit to eat your Highness? It’s a rabbit one of the wardens give me. Tasty, and the smoke from the fire don’t affect the taste, much.”</p><p>“No, thank you Willie.” Albrecht pulled up a farrier’s stool that lay against the wall, and sat in silence for awhile by the fire. Willie simply watched him while he ate. Willie seemed to catch the serious mood, and he doused the fire putting his pan and its uneaten rabbit to the side. Then he simply sat, and waited for the Prince to speak.</p><p>“Willie. I need you to do something for me, as your Prince.”</p><p>“You’re always my Prince, your Highness. Whatever you want.”</p><p>“No Willie. I have always been Prince Albrecht, an older boy that you give a bow to, and then go about your business. An older boy who likes to ride and likes horses too, and who doesn’t make you do too much scraping, and who likes you to speak freely. Now I need you to do something for me as your ’Prince.’ A command that you will obey, because I have given it. Without dissent. Without question. And without failure. Of course I can make such a command. But I need to know if you can do it?”</p><p>“I like you your Highness. You and the family has always been square by me. I had no place to go, and nothing to do, and now I eat regular, stay warm mostly, and get to spend my time with horses, which I love. I am always grateful. But I think I get what you mean. You’re going to ask for something more, and I got to decide before knowing what it is whether I can say I will do it.”</p><p>There was a nod from Albrecht.</p><p>“You know. I’ve seen you ride Albrecht. You push your horses hard, but you never brought one back lathered or with a whip mark. You’ve made me shovel until I was sore, but you never asked me more than I can do. Just a couple of weeks ago you brought your sister here and you treated her hard too, but it seemed to be something she needed, and she didn’ seem to bear you no ill, and though I treated her kind o’harsh, you did’nt do anything to me on account that you knew that I didn’t know. That seemed fair. I guess what I mean is that even when you ask someone to do something you don’t seem to ask them to do more than they can do, and you treat them fair whether they succeed or fail. I guess I can agree.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. But remember that hunt with Whispering Wind, that just broken colt. I rode him hard, and he snapped a leg, and we had to put him down.”</p><p>“Yeah, but that weren’t your fault. You couldn’t seen that hole on the other side of the fence. Everyone said so, and I asked all the grooms. No one said anything against you.” Willie paused, and seemed to reflect before going on. “Oh. I see. Just because you’re fair don’t mean you can guarantee it’s going to go alright.” Another pause, and Willie poked at the ashes of his cook fire with a stick. “Yes your Highness.” Willie got up from his squat, went down on one knee and bowed his head. “I will do as you command.”</p><p>“Thank you Willie. Please take your seat again. I need you to take my horse Vanguard to the central stables in the city.”</p><p>Willie’s eye grew wide. “That’s all I got to do? That didn’t need that speech. I like going to the city. I been there twice you know. When you want the horse there. I can tell Stable Master first thing in the morning, and it will be there by noon.”</p><p>“No Willie. No Stable Master, and I need you to go now.”</p><p>“But if I don’t tell the Stable Master he’ll think I run off and stole the horse. I could get whipped or worse if they catch me.”</p><p>“No Stable Master, Willie. And I need you to go now.”</p><p>Willie looked at Albrecht. Albrecht’s expression was flat, his voice sounded determined, important.</p><p>“I guess I should’ve know’d it wasn’t going to be that simple. How do I get them to take me and the horse at the stable?”</p><p>“Tell them William Tell sent you. Say it. Who sent you? … Good. Tell them William Tell sent you. You will be given a stable for the horse with provisions of hay, and whatever they can scrounge for you. You will receive a message telling you to watch a window in a particular building. You will either be watching that window or tending to my horse. You will not tour the city. You will not look at the shops. You will not dream, or idle, or wander or walk. You will not sleep except as needed to be able to watch that window. Do you understand? … Good. And if someone catches you on my horse before you get there you admit to stealing it. No excuses. No telling of this story. You must trust that someone will come and get me, and that I will treat you as fair as I can.”</p><p>Willie stood. He seemed taller. He began to nod, but then stopped himself. “Yes. Your Highness. As you command.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht stood now too. “You are to watch that window for a white ‘X’. It may be tape. It may be cloth. It might be something else, but if you see that white X you get my horse and you come to me at all speed. I don’t care if you kill that horse riding it into the ground, you are to get to me, and me alone, as fast as you can. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes. Your Highness.”</p><p>Prince Albrecht reached out to rest a hand on Willie’s shoulder. “I will not forget this William. I will repay your service and trust when I can. Now on your way. I will stay until you are off, and then you are on own. Godspeed. And Long Live the Queen.”</p><p>Willie had never been called William before. He wasn’t even sure that William was his name. He had only ever been called Willie as far as he could remember, but the Prince’s words made him proud, and made him swear to himself that he would not fail. “God save the Queen.” William repeated softly, and then without waiting to be dismissed, he grabbed the Prince’s saddle off its hook and went into Vanguard’s stable. In less than five minutes Willie was leading the horse outside, where a half-moon provided sufficient light to see a dirt track leading off between tended fields. Prince Albrecht remained in the stables with his head bowed and eyes closed. He listened to hoof beats fade away, and when they were gone he repeated softly one more time, “I will not forget. God save the Queen.” Then Albrecht slowly made his way back to the castle noting that he felt very much older than when he had awakened that morning.</p></root><a href="chapter9.html">Prior Chapter Self-Defense</a><p><a href="chapter11.html">Next Chapter Schooled</a></p></body></html>
