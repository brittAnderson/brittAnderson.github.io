<body><h2>Chapter - …—…</h2><p>Stunned ’Gina walked slowly to her room. She looked neither right nor<br/>left. She ascended stairs without attention. With her gaze up and to the<br/>right she was in a state of reflection. The knife scared her, but it<br/>also focused her. Her fear before had been diffuse, and therefore had<br/>been distracting. Now her fear was pointed, and she knew who to fear:<br/>Jimmie.</p><p>Or did she? Had he tried to kill her or warn her? Had he mistaken her<br/>for someone else? She thought he had recognized her, but maybe he had<br/>recognized her as someone else? ’Gina was sitting now at her vanity. A<br/>candle burned on the table beside her. She caught her own gaze in the<br/>mirror. She stared at her face.</p><p>Jimmie. He had “stolen her nose”, and pulled coins from her ears. He had<br/>endless handkerchiefs in his cheeks, and could read Cook’s mind. He knew<br/>more knock-knock jokes than there were days, and he had played with her<br/>when she was bored, the little, lonely girl in a household of busy<br/>servant folk. On days when carriage calls were not expected he would<br/>polish the carriage brass and then, when no one was looking, he would<br/>show her his “circus knife.” And he taught her how to hold it and to<br/>throw it. How could he not have recognized her? She looked again in the<br/>mirror. Was she so different? No. Her hair was clean and brushed, and<br/>her clothes were pretty silk, but she was what she had always been, the<br/>servant’s daughter: Regina. Jimmie could not mistake her.</p><p>Could it have been a warning? The Swiss Guard carried knives, but theirs<br/>were different. She had seen Hans’ and Rene’s. Theirs were not circus<br/>blades. Not so flat nor large. It was not a Swiss Guard knife. For all<br/>the time she had observed the men there was not one time when she had<br/>seen any of the Guards speak to Jimmie, and they were a close crew. They<br/>would not have had a member in the Queen’s household and not have<br/>acknowledged that man unless… No. There was no unless. He could not<br/>have been a guard.</p><p>Jimmie was a spy. When you admitted it to yourself, it was so obvious. A<br/>friendly, flirtatious footman who spent his time loitering around the<br/>servants’ kitchen gossiping with the maids. He was someone that everyone<br/>loved to see. He told knock-knock jokes to children, pinched the cheeks<br/>of maiden maids, and told bawdy stories of his roust-about days to the<br/>black suited men over gin on Sunday afternoons. Everyone spoke to<br/>Jimmie, and Jimmie spoke to everyone. The staff always described his<br/>gift of gab, but as ’Gina thought more about the conversations she had<br/>heard she remembered how, while they had always begun with a Jimmie<br/>story, they always ended with the others trying to match him and top him<br/>with stories of their own. Those that did not have his life of adventure<br/>frequently met the challenge by reciting household gossip of upstairs<br/>life. Visitors and parties. Comings and goings. With a bit of deduction<br/>a person could learn a lot about the Queen’s plans from<br/>cross-referencing the servants sightings.</p><p>The dinner. The interruption. The Ambassador’s abrupt panic. The Queen<br/>had been to town just a few streets away. Jimmie must have visited the<br/>embassy and some important warning had been relayed to the Ambassador’s<br/>ears. Jimmie could pass along his secrets. Whenever the carriage came to<br/>town Jimmie came to town. When the Queen or her agents traveled on her<br/>behalf Jimmie was there to observe and report. An overnight stay at some<br/>cousin’s castle gave an opportunity for meeting people and filing<br/>reports. The more ’Gina reflected, the more she saw that Jimmie was the<br/>spy. The more convinced she became that Jimmie was the spy, the more she<br/>knew this meant that Jimmie knew who she was. He obviously had not known<br/>she was at the Andalonian ambassador’s residence. He had been too<br/>surprised for that, but he knew where she was now, and he could easily<br/>guess why. And even if he was wrong or uncertain, the fact she was in an<br/>Andalonian carriage with a Kaiserkönig crest could not lead him to any<br/>innocent conclusions.</p><p>The Andalonian carriage. The smile and the wink at Diego. He had been to<br/>the Andalonian embassy several times. It was the Andalonians! Jimmy was<br/>passing his information to the Andalonians. The Ambassador was ambitious<br/>and patriotic and opportunistic. He was spying on the Queen, and Jimmie<br/>was his agent. Or something like that. Was it the whole family? Diego?<br/>Helene?</p><p>Probably not Diego. At least not knowingly. He had been too ready to<br/>talk of Jimmie and their relation, but then he also stole her letters<br/>for the head mistress. It was no longer possible to explain that as<br/>jealousy or paranoia on the part of Miss Bostick. Diego had been given<br/>instructions and Miss Bostick must somehow be connected with the plot.<br/>And what a connection she would be. Head Mistress of a school for all<br/>the rich, royal, and diplomatic children of the capitol. A place from<br/>which to watch, and pry, and spy, and put together pieces. Who was<br/>friends with whom? Which families vacationed together? Just as Jimmie<br/>could listen to the Castle gossip, so could Miss Bostick listen to the<br/>school’s. And like jigsaw puzzle masters they could put the pieces<br/>together and see a greater picture. Were they together or two separate<br/>threads of Andalonian intrigue?</p><p>While ’Gina was eventually to layout her conclusions in this clear and<br/>linear way, it had been the work of hours of surmises and deductions.<br/>Retreats and re-calculations. She heard the church bells tolling three,<br/>and she did not know what to do. How was she to alert the Queen?</p><p>Perhaps she could just leave. Walk the way to the castle keeping low and<br/>within a few hours she could be home again and tell her story. She rose<br/>and stretched, and walked to gaze out the window at the moon lit street<br/>below. She saw a shadow waver. A man was in the gap where Willie had<br/>been. A match flared and lit a stranger’s face. Coincidence? Then<br/>another stranger came, dark clad, cap low, trailing smoke from his<br/>cigarette. The first man gestured without looking towards her window,<br/>then towards the entrance way below. The second put his hand upon the<br/>shoulder of the first and patted. The first man nodded and walked away<br/>down the street and the second slid into the alcove and for a few<br/>minutes more ’Gina observed the intermittent glow of the cigarette tip<br/>as it brightened with each breath.</p><p>She returned to sit at her desk and dropped her face into her hands. For<br/>awhile she sobbed deeply, and then she slammed a fist upon the table.<br/>There still must be a way. She began to think.</p><p>Listening to the church bells strike four she paused with that upward<br/>gaze of concentration that the Queen had noticed and which she shared<br/>with her mother. Than she hurriedly reached for pen and stationary and<br/>began to write.</p><p>When the letter was addressed and sealed she went once again to the<br/>window, and stared down at the empty moon lit street and the dark<br/>alcove. There was no sign of anyone. Perhaps she had been too nervous.<br/>Too young. Too suspicious. Too scared by two men on the way home from<br/>the pub asking each other for a light. Then she detected movement, and a<br/>figure jogged along the pavement. It slowed and walked the last few<br/>steps to the dark alcove where a man now appeared. Even from this<br/>distance, and in the dark, she recognized the jogging man as Jimmie. For<br/>one thing he was still in his footman’s livery. He was in conversation<br/>with the first man when ’Gina decided she could wait no longer.</p><p>She could not mail the letter from the school. It would be waylaid by<br/>Diego, or the Head Mistress, and even if they deemed it innocent there<br/>is no reason to suspect that they would post it on without delay. There<br/>should not be a delay. The Queen must know about the spies.</p><p>At this juncture, deep in thought, ’Gina heard the slight rap on her<br/>door, then watched it open and closed and saw the tear stained face of<br/>her friend Helene.</p><p>“Janus? What is going on? Our house is in a frenzy, and my Father is<br/>cursing you. I have runaway. I don’t understand!”</p><p>’Gina looked at the girl, she seemed younger now, eyes puffy, cheeks<br/>shiny and moist with tears. ’Gina felt older. Helene was a paradox.<br/>Could ’Gina trust her? Was Helene her only ally, this daughter of her<br/>enemy? Or just another clever manipulation?</p><p>Candle light lit the room and the two girls stared until ’Gina made her<br/>decision and spoke.</p><p>“I need you to mail this letter.”</p><p>Helene looked confused, “What? I don’t understand. I don’t understand.<br/>What is going on? What has happened? Tell me Janus. I thought we were<br/>friends. I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Helene! Listen! If you are my friend, and I truly need one, you will do<br/>what I ask without understanding. I need you to mail this letter now.<br/>Now!” She yelled at teary-eyed, confused Helene.</p><p>Helene came closer. Spoke quietly. “I don’t understand.”</p><p>“There isn’t time to understand. You only need to understand if you are<br/>my friend.”</p><p>“I am your friend Janus, but why do you need me to mail a letter in the<br/>middle of the night. Why do I have to do it? Just drop it in the slot in<br/>the hall.”</p><p>“Because people want to kill me.”</p><p>Helene’s eyes opened wide, and her mouth drooped open too. ’Gina guessed<br/>that poor Helene thought this had something to do with her being a<br/>Kaiserkönig. While ’Gina felt bad to deceiving her friend, there was no<br/>time for explanations now. “Do you trust me Helene? Can I trust you?<br/>Will you risk all for a friend?” A true statement, but a manipulation.<br/>’Gina did not enjoy the deceit, but was moved by her desperation.</p><p>Helene responded, “I would risk all for you friend,” at which ’Gina<br/>kissed her on the cheek, and wiped at her own sour tears. “Take this<br/>letter,” ’Gina said. “And go to a letterbox as far away from school as<br/>you can get before dawn; where no one will see you post it. Drop it in<br/>and hurry back.”</p><p>As ’Gina spoke this last, Helene had already begun to turn around with<br/>the letter pressed tight in her hands. ’Gina gave her one more, brief,<br/>hug, and watched as Helene cracked the door, spied along the hallway in<br/>both directions, and then slid out into the black hall, and disappeared.</p><p>Alone in her dimly lit room, and shadowed by dark thoughts, ’Gina locked<br/>the door. ’Gina snuffed the candle and all became black. ’Gina could see<br/>a faint light at the window from the setting moon. She hurried over to<br/>the window. Standing to the side, ’Gina saw the two shadowy men arguing.<br/>Then Jimmie slapped the man hard, and both figures froze. She watched<br/>the first one retreat to his alcove, and Jimmie began to cross the<br/>street towards the entrance to the school. Half way across the street he<br/>was met by a figure coming out of the school. It was the Head Mistress,<br/>still in her bed clothes; with only a coat over her shoulders. There<br/>were hurried words between the Head Mistress and Jimmie. ’Gina could not<br/>make out what was said. Then the Head Mistress and Jimmie both turned<br/>towards the school.</p><p>’Gina exhaled one large sob in her first panic. He was coming for her.<br/>Jimmie was coming for her. The sign. The sign. They said someone would<br/>be watching for her. She raced across to her bed sheet and using the<br/>sheers from her sewing kit she cut one long white strip and then tore it<br/>in two. She used a hair pin to stick one end of one of the strips in one<br/>corner of her window, and then used a second hair pin to stick the other<br/>end in the cross corner making one half of her rescue sign in the<br/>window. ’Gina reached for the other strip when she heard the steps<br/>outside her door. “May we come in Regina?” And she heard Jimmie laugh.<br/>When he discovered the door was locked he cursed.</p><p>Regina did not know what to do. They would kill her, she felt certain of<br/>that, but would they also make her talk? She would she tell them of the<br/>Queen, and Hans, and all the plans? She did not want to die, but more<br/>than that she did not want to fail the Queen. ’Gina wanted to beat these<br/>people. ’Gina knew they would just use her as one more puzzle piece in<br/>their plot to torment her Queen: the mother of her friends Albrecht and<br/>Mietzie; the leader of her land; and the woman who ever worried how to<br/>protect the people of her realm. ’Gina would not let down her Queen.<br/>’Gina heard a crash upon the door, and more swearing. Another crash and<br/>the hinges began to give. Another crash. Heavier. The Head Mistress and<br/>Jimmie together were throwing themselves at the door. ’Gina saw the top<br/>hinge begin to pull from the jam. ’Gina looked about in a hurry, but not<br/>in panic. She was now alone in thought and purpose. She saw at once the<br/>matchbox on her vanity. She tore it open and poured the cubes into her<br/>hand. Six came out, but she managed to hold on to only two. When the<br/>next crash came two bodies cascaded to the floor. ’Gina brought hand to<br/>mouth and sucked both cubes in. She felt the sweetness rest on her<br/>teeth. She stood facing the angry faces of Miss Bostick and Jimmie.</p><p>“Tell us girl! What have you done? What have you told the Queen.”</p><p>’Gina stood silent. Not because she was afraid to answer, but because<br/>the cubes had not yet dissolved and she was afraid to let them see.</p><p>Jimmie slapped her hard, and ’Gina worked to keep her mouth shut. It was<br/>working. When she looked again both figures had become wavy.</p><p>“Dammit Girl. No games. Our heads are in play. What have you told the<br/>Queen?”</p><p>Jimmie grabbed her hand and laid it on the vanity. He held it by the<br/>wrist and with his other hand brought out a knife, a bigger one than the<br/>one he threw, and held it over the end of her little finger. Then he<br/>looked at her with a questioning air. His gaze met hers. When she said<br/>nothing he cut down in a quick movement that severed the tip of her<br/>finger. The tip fell to the floor, and was followed by a small stream of<br/>red. ’Gina did not feel the pain she expected. She did not feel much of<br/>anything. Her perception was of a slowed down version of events, as if<br/>she were watching a play. It replayed. The tip of her finger detached.<br/>It fell to the carpet. Then all that ’Gina sensed was darkness and<br/>silence.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The girl melted in Jimmie’s arms and he let her drop to the floor where<br/>she fell upon her severed finger tip.</p><p>“What have you done!” Miss Bostick screamed at him.</p><p>With his anger at Regina’s fainting, his perceived failure, and Miss<br/>Bostick’s scolding, he struck back with his empty hand making a mighty<br/>slap across the Head Mistress’s face. The sound of the slap seemed to<br/>absorb all other sounds, and the two stared at each other. Jimmie saw<br/>blood at the corner of Miss Bostick’s lip, and nodded at her. “You’re<br/>right. That one weren’t deserved nor fairly signaled. You are owed one.”</p><p>Miss Bostick reached back and with her open right hand and swung as hard<br/>as she could. She connected with his face. Immediately her hand print<br/>appeared as a pink blotch on his white cheek. Shortly thereafter a small<br/>trickle of blood ran down from a cut in his lip. The two stared at each<br/>other. Then, without a sign, they leaned in and kissed.</p><p>Pulling back Miss Bostick asked, “Is she dead?”</p><p>“No. Can’t be.” replied Jimmie. “Not from losing a bit of her little<br/>finger. Must have fainted.”</p><p>“Well then pick her up, and let’s go.”</p><p>Jimmie sheathed his knife. Scooped up the little girl, swung her over<br/>his shoulder, and followed Miss Bostick out of the room.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Helene was just about ready to leave the school when she heard movement<br/>on the steps. She stepped into a dark doorway and watched the Head<br/>Mistress fly by at a run her bed clothes streaming. Frozen by her fear<br/>of being expelled; Helene still had not quite come to believe the<br/>extremity of Janus’s claims, she stood there still when Miss Bostick<br/>returned with Jimmie. Helene had seen this man. He visited the Embassy<br/>and did tricks, but now his face was a glower. Anger shone, and threat,<br/>and menace. Helene believed all Janus said now, but her fear was so<br/>great she could not move. Helene heard the pounding on Janus’s door, and<br/>the screaming of the name Regian. Helene was scared by the threatening<br/>tone, and confused; who was Regina? Helene did not have time to puzzle<br/>this out before she heard the first crash of Jimmie trying to force the<br/>door. Helene stepped out slightly from the shadows. She spied along the<br/>hall. While confusion remained, doubts were gone. Her friend was in<br/>danger. Her friend. The girl that had stuck up for her and Diego when no<br/>else would. The only girl who would dare face Miss Bostick. That girl,<br/>that friend had given her a responsibility, a responsibility that might<br/>be of life and death importance. Helene shrunk back into the shadows.<br/>Then she heard the crack of wood splintering. Helene stepped out. She<br/>heard the next charge, louder, and the thunk and tumble of bodies on the<br/>floor. Helene’s legs found life, and she raced toward the school’s<br/>entrance, and down its front steps.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Willie shivered and winced. Since the big men had come and taken his<br/>viewing spot, Willie had been forced to watch ’Gina’s window from a less<br/>comfortable spot. The only other shielded location on the street that<br/>Willie had been able to find was inside the doorway of a darkened home a<br/>little further down the street. The big men came and went. Willie did<br/>not feel he could move or shift his position for fear of giving himself<br/>away. He did not know who they were or why they were there. He reasoned<br/>that if Albrecht had sent them, Albrecht would have told them about him.<br/>Since they did not seem to know about him, they didn’t come from<br/>Albrecht. To Willie that meant that they were not to be trusted.</p><p>Willie was so tired. He had been on the street almost constantly.<br/>Occasionally he had drunk from the fountain. One of the woman who lived<br/>on the street and had often seen him there took him for a foundling and<br/>occasionally left him stale bread with a bit of cheese, only slightly<br/>moldy. Willie was grateful for her generosity. He knew he would have<br/>been excused if he had gone to find food or to wash himself, but he<br/>could not do it. He knew that what he was being asked to do was<br/>important. He did not know what it was exactly, or why it was he who had<br/>been tasked. But he would not let Albrecht down. He might not be a<br/>soldier like Albrecht, or a Swiss Guard like Hans, but that did not mean<br/>he was worth less or that his duty did not matter. It was important, and<br/>it was his responsibility. Over the last weeks Willie had grown thinner<br/>and dirtier watching Regina through her window. Only when he knew she<br/>should be in class did he allow himself a few hours sleep back at the<br/>stables where he would brush and walk Albrecht’s horse, and maybe have a<br/>bite to eat from the stable master. But for the rest of the day he was<br/>in one crack or another on Regina’s street staring at her window.</p><p>Willie heard the men arguing. Willie thought one of the voices sounded<br/>familiar, but he could not place it or understand what was said. There!<br/>What was that? The first half of an X was clearly swathed across ’Gina’s<br/>window. What did that mean? Why did she stop? Was she in trouble or not?<br/>What was he supposed to do? He came out of his hiding place now and he<br/>looked down the street. The man from the alcove had stepped forward too.<br/>Willie and the big man looked at one another and then both looked back<br/>up at the window of Regina’s room. Shadows. Forms. He saw the shadows<br/>whir and then Willie saw ’Gina’s head snap back. He heard a moment later<br/>the clear sound of the slap. Willie bounced on his toes. Was it an ’X’<br/>or not? What was he supposed to do?</p><p>The man from the alcove had come a couple of steps closer to Willie, but<br/>he stopped at the sound of the slap and looked back up the window. They<br/>both watched as ’Gina’s shadow slid out of view. Then the two, Willie<br/>and the alcove watcher, turned to look at each other. The man from the<br/>alcove shrugged.</p><p>At this moment, a small figure ran from the entrance of the school. Her<br/>light colored clothing caught and reflected the moon light. The alcove<br/>man took two quick steps in her direction, then redirected and raced<br/>into the school building. Willie by reflex, not reflection, chased after<br/>the small running figure.</p><p>Willie was gaining on her quickly. He saw that she was smaller and<br/>younger than he was. Willie was surprised. “Stop!” he shouted.</p><p>Helene looked over her shoulder. Someone was chasing her. She kept<br/>running.</p><p>Willie pushed her from behind, and Helene fell in a sprawl on the ground<br/>scraping her knees and hands, but never giving up her grip on the<br/>letter. “What are you doing? Why are you running? What do you know about<br/>those people and Regina?” Willie shouted at her.</p><p>It was that name again. Regina. Helene assumed this boy must be with the<br/>other people since he called Janus by the same, strange name the others<br/>had used. He must not get the letter. Helene ignored his question, and<br/>got up to start running again. Helene made it only a couple of steps<br/>before Willie pushed her down again. “Stay down.” he said. Willie saw<br/>her try to shield something, and he rolled her over to grab at what it<br/>was she held in her hand. Helene scratched at his face, catching him on<br/>the cheek. When Willie pulled back she got up again to run, and this<br/>time Willie pushed her hard and she was thrown back against the wall of<br/>the house behind her. She dropped the letter. Helene was on her hands<br/>and knees gasping. Willie picked up the letter and looked at it. He<br/>could not read much, but he recognized the Kaiserkönig crest, and he<br/>knew, as every child knew from bedtime stories and soldier tales, that<br/>the Kaiserkönig line dreamed of overthrowing the Queen. Somehow this<br/>must fit together. Somehow this must have something to do with the<br/>people who were threatening Regina. This must be one of the letters of<br/>the Kaiserkönigs to one of their spies or assassins. It had been an ’X’;<br/>just not a completed one, because Regina had been interrupted before she<br/>could finish it. Distracted by his thoughts Willie failed to pay<br/>attention to Helene. She leaped on him. She was scratching and clawing.<br/>She was trying desperately to get the letter back. Not out of malice,<br/>but only as a defensive maneuver, Willie ducked and pushed at her<br/>attacking figure. Helene lost her balance. She fell back striking the<br/>back of her head on the pavement. Willie heard her moan and saw her<br/>writhe. He waited no longer, but ran for the stables holding the letter<br/>in his hand.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Willie took Albrecht’s steed from the stall, threw only a bit in its<br/>mouth and mounted bareback. Willie wheeled the horse out of the stables<br/>and clattered down the cobblestones at a trot. Once Willie reached the<br/>dirt track on the edge of town he pointed toward the castle. Willie<br/>assumed his jockey’s stance and whipped the horse with the reins until<br/>it was at a full gallop. Each time the steed slowed Willie prodded it<br/>on. After five miles the steed begun to froth. It shook its head as if<br/>in disappointment with itself. Another five minutes and the horse<br/>stumbled, but it did not fall. Willie wanted to ease off, but he<br/>remembered Albrecht’s words. Willie remembered his duty. He thought<br/>about ’Gina and the desperate, clawing child running with a hidden<br/>letter in the night. He continued to whip his unsteady mount. Faster.<br/>Faster. A few seconds later one of the horse’s legs buckled again. Both<br/>horse and rider went down. Willie had practiced falls, and he tucked and<br/>rolled coming out of the crash with only bruises, but the horse was<br/>lamed. With barely a pause it rose and with a glance at Willie began to<br/>trot lamely toward the castle. Willie mounted it on the run crying; big<br/>huge tears rolled down his cheeks. He resumed whipping the horse with<br/>the reins. Willie yelled. “Damn you. Damn you. Damn you.” It was not<br/>clear who he was damning. “Why did you have to go and do that? Damn you.<br/>Damn me.” It was still not fast enough. The horse strained forward. It<br/>did not need the whip to goad it. It was a warrior’s horse. Willie<br/>kicked with both heels, and the horse broke into a weird limping gallop.<br/>Both rider and mount knew it was not fast enough. It was not fast<br/>enough! Albrecht had told him the mission was more important than the<br/>horse. Willie had always loved this horse, and he had grown to love it<br/>more during this ride: its courage, its strength, its sacrifice, but<br/>Albrecht had said… Duty demanded… Willie slapped the horse again.<br/>Willie kicked at the horse again. The horse sensed it needed to go<br/>faster. It needed to go faster. And it did go faster. The horse trusted<br/>Willie. If Willie needed it to go faster, lame or not, the horse would<br/>go faster. For five more minutes the horse galloped again, with only a<br/>slight limp. Then Willie heard the snap when one of the horse’s forelegs<br/>broke. The horse went down head first propelling Willie forward. Willie<br/>threw himself to the side as thousands of pounds of exhausted beast<br/>cascaded past. Still the horse tried to rise. Tried to trot forward on<br/>its broken leg. Willie heard a second bone snap. The horse knew that<br/>Willie needed it to go fast. It tried to rise again, but neither foreleg<br/>moved as it was supposed to. The horse skidded forward on its knees its<br/>powerful hind legs pushing forward while it neighed in pain and<br/>frustration. Willie screamed. Willie howled. Willie cried. And Willie<br/>ran toward the castle. He could hear the frustrated, tortured whinnying<br/>horse fading behind him valiantly still trying to do its duty; to get<br/>its rider to the castle. Willie ran, and he ran.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The police station in the school quarter was a generally slow and lazy<br/>assignment. Diplomats’ and Royals’ kids tended not to get into too much<br/>trouble, and when they did their parents covered it up. Also, the<br/>parents tended not to tolerate ne’er-do-wells in the neighborhood of<br/>their children, and so riff-raff were soon run out. Thus, finding a<br/>scraped, screaming, and inconsolable child lying on the streets near the<br/>school at dawn was a bit of a novelty. The policeman had guessed at her<br/>identity from his knowledge of the community. They station sent word to<br/>the Andalonian Embassy.</p><p>About a half hour after the messenger had been dispatched the Ambassador<br/>appeared at the station. “I believe you are holding my daughter. What<br/>are the charges?”</p><p>“Well, there aren’t exactly any charges Ambassador, but …”</p><p>“No charges? Well then release her at once.”</p><p>“Now Ambassador, we have to ask…”</p><p>Again the Ambassador interrupted. “What are the charges?”</p><p>“Well, Sir there are not any charges, but …”</p><p>The Ambassador erupted. “Well then. Have you kidnapped my child? If you<br/>have no charges then release my daughter to me. Now. If you do not, I<br/>will be forced to file a diplomatic protest with the Queen’s Law<br/>Enforcement magistrate describing the illegal hostilities laid against<br/>me and my poor child by your precinct.”</p><p>The Desk Sargent stared in disbelief at this speech. The man’s child had<br/>been brought in screaming from the streets and her father was yelling at<br/>him for mistreatment. The Desk Sargent also knew that no one cared what<br/>he thought when it came to diplomatic cases. Those people just did<br/>whatever they wanted.</p><p>“As you wish Ambassador. Follow me please.” He led the Ambassador back<br/>into the cells where little Helene laid rocking side to side. On hearing<br/>the door to her cell unlocked, she looked around. Seeing her father<br/>enter she leaped up and said at once. “Oh Papa. Janus … ” but before<br/>she could say another word he slapped her across the face and told her<br/>to shut up. Stunned, she obeyed, and the Desk Sargent looked away.</p><p>The Ambassador reached down and took her hand. “Let’s go,” he said.<br/>“Now.”</p><p>The Ambassador led Helene out the front of the police station. The Desk<br/>Sargent followed them to the door, and watched them descend down the<br/>steps to board a carriage with the Andalonian crest. The carriage was<br/>loaded down with trunks and baskets, and trailing behind it a cart also<br/>filled with trunks and a few pieces of furniture. The Desk Sargent<br/>watched the Ambassador pass his daughter into the cramped interior of<br/>the coach, after which he climbed up beside the coachman, who without<br/>further orders jerked the reins and the carriage moved off at a trot.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Mr. Goldthread was actually pacing, and it was making Regina’s mother<br/>very nervous. The two Swiss Guards, René and Hans, looked at him, and<br/>looked at each other. Mr. Goldthread caught their glances, and turned<br/>without comment and left the room. Hans closed the door behind the<br/>departing Mr. Goldthread. The tension in the room eased slightly.<br/>Regina’s mother looked at the envelope and the letter in front of her.<br/>The letter that Willie brought had not been a note from spies, and a<br/>puzzled Albrecht immediately brought the note to Mr. Goldthread. It was<br/>clear from Willie’s story that something bad was happening, but it was<br/>not at all clear what it was or what it meant. Albrecht had left Willie<br/>crying in his room where the night staff had brought him. Then Albrecht<br/>had gone in search of Mr. Goldthread. Mr. Goldthread had roused the<br/>guards, and awakened the Queen who sat in her war room ready to plan,<br/>but for what?</p><p>The letter Willie brought spoke of stationary.</p><p>Breakfast plans were halted. Regina’s mother was summoned. Regina’s<br/>mother sat reading the letter that had been addressed to her by name,<br/>but with the title of Private Secretary of the Countess of Kaiserkönig<br/>and to a standard Kaiserkönig address. The letter was brief and<br/>essentially said that Janus had determined to have new stationary<br/>produced along a new modern pattern that she had observed in the<br/>capitol. ’Gina, writing as Janus, had charged the Secretary to order her<br/>100 sheets. She wanted it produced along the lines of the hand-drawn<br/>model enclosed. And a hand-drawn model was enclosed. A thick sheet of<br/>creme colored hand pressed paper was enclosed. In it’s center, where<br/>normally the writing would go, all was blank. Mr. Goldthread and his men<br/>had gone over this section of the letter repeatedly and thouroughly. The<br/>paper had been held up to the light. No message appeared. The page had<br/>been held over steam. No message appeared. Various reagents of known<br/>invisible inks had been dripped upon its surface. No message appeared.</p><p>The page remained blank, or nearly blank; there was the hand-drawn<br/>example of a border that was the model for the stationary to be ordered.<br/>It ran along the perimeter of the page. The decoration had been,<br/>presumably, the cover story for the message hidden in the center, but<br/>there was no message there, or at least no message could be found. Had<br/>Regina not had time to finish her letter? Was it all some horrible<br/>misunderstanding? Was Regina in danger or not? Was the Queen?</p><p>After Mr. Goldthread and the cryptanalysts of the Queen’s detachment of<br/>Swiss Guards had spent two hours pouring over the letter and testing it<br/>without results it was shown to the Queen. She had sat in her war room<br/>looking at the envelope and pages.</p><p>“You have tested and studied the envelope and first page too Mr.<br/>Goldthread?”</p><p>“Yes we have Your Majesty, but if ’Gina had hidden the message there,<br/>there would have been no reason to include an additional page. We<br/>believe therefore, strongly, that that page has been included to<br/>communicate to us the message.”</p><p>The Queen continued to stare at the pages that lay before her. “Why do<br/>you think Mr. Goldthread that rather than addressing this letter to her<br/>fake Aunt she chose to address it to her mother by name?”</p><p>“She wanted to make sure the post office contact saw it and brought it<br/>here?” Mr. Goldthread said. The Queen raised her eyebrows. “No, Your<br/>Majesty, I do not like that explanation either, but I am afraid I have<br/>nothing better to offer.”</p><p>“Did you ever think Mr. Goldthread that she might have addressed it to<br/>her mother, because it was her mother she wanted to see it?”</p><p>“No Your Majesty. It had not.” And picking up the envelope, letter, and<br/>sample stationary, he turned and left the room bringing it down into the<br/>Regina’s study room off the kitchen pantry where Regina’s mother now<br/>sat. And where, after depositing the pages, he had begun pacing until he<br/>received the dismissing look from the Swiss Guards.</p><p>Regina’s mother stared hard at the pages, and then leaned back sighing.<br/>“I don’t know what I am doing or what I am supposed to do. Is my girl in<br/>danger?”</p><p>The Swiss Guard René looked at her squarely. “We do not know for sure,<br/>but we believe it likely. The boy Willie’s story is confused, but it<br/>appears that she was making the signal for extraction when she was<br/>stopped. Although he didn’t know it importance, Willie hurried this<br/>letter on its way to us. It is our best hope at the moment for finding<br/>out what is happening. That is our best hope for helping Regina.”</p><p>And so Regina’s mother returned her gaze to the pages. She did not touch<br/>them. She simply looked. Occasionally she would cock her head to one<br/>side, and then it would straighten. The guards simply sat and watched.<br/>Once Mr. Goldthread knocked at the door and looked in. Hans shook his<br/>head and Mr. Goldthread retired.</p><p>Regina’s mother fidgeted. Both guards looked up. She stood, and they<br/>stood up. Then she screamed. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what<br/>it says. I don’t know what it means. I am just staring and staring, but<br/>I don’t know what it means. I want my baby girl!” And she stared<br/>fiercely at the guard Hans.</p><p>Hans calmly walked over to Regina’s mother. He bent down a bit so his<br/>eyes were on the same level as Regina’s mother’s eyes. “Your daughter is<br/>very smart, no?”</p><p>“Yes, too smart.” Regina’s mother sighed.</p><p>“No,” Hans said. “The apple does not fall far from the tree.”</p><p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Smart daughters have smart mothers. You will figure it out. Calm<br/>yourself. Focus and be patient. It will come to you. Perhaps a cup of<br/>tea will help?”</p><p>Regina’s mother nodded. “Yes. Maybe. A cup of tea would be nice.” She<br/>rubbed her eyes.</p><p>Hans nodded, and reached around with his hand groping for the little<br/>rope that would ring the bell for the servant to bring tea.</p><p>“No,” Regina’s mother said, “We don’t have those here in the servant’s<br/>quarters, you have to …” Hans began to walk to the door. “Stop!”<br/>Regina’s mother commanded.</p><p>Hans was disciplined. He froze. He and René watched Regina’s mother cock<br/>her head to the side and look up into the sky. They looked at each<br/>other. An idea was coming. “Give me that sheet of paper.” Regina’s<br/>mother ordered. “ No. The other one.” Hans dropped the letter and handed<br/>her the odd piece of sample stationary. Regina’s mother held it. Looked<br/>at it. Rotated it, and seemed to be searching along the perimeter where<br/>there ran the series of small and large circles. “Come with me.” she<br/>said, and the two disciplined soldiers followed her as she ran down the<br/>hall into the servants’ area.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Mietzie paced in her room. Since shortly before dawn guards had been<br/>placed in the wing of the royal residence. The children had been<br/>quarantined to their rooms. Mietzie hated it. Why wouldn’t anyone tell<br/>them anything? They were children, true, but not knowing was worse than<br/>knowing. And alone. Mr. Goldthread said it was better if they were not<br/>concentrated, and this was what they had practiced. Still. The little<br/>ones must be crazy with fear, and she herself was very nervous. What was<br/>going on? Could this have anything to do with Regina?</p><p>Then Mietzie heard the bell in her room. It was the bell that only she<br/>and Regina used for messaging. It began to ring. Short peel (.) Short<br/>peel (.) Short peel (.) Long peel (-) Long peel (-) Long peel (-) Short<br/>peel (.) Short peel (.) Short peel (.) And then it repeated all again.<br/>Mietzie looked at her door. Mietzie knew that outside guards stood<br/>there. They were under orders not to let her leave. With no hesitation<br/>Mietzie walked over and pounded her fist on the button that opened the<br/>door for servant’s access. The two cats, Queenie and Chevalier, leaped<br/>down from her bed, and when the door was opened wide enough, Mietzie<br/>squeezed through and began to sprint down the corridor with the two cats<br/>trailing right behind.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>In the bell room René, Hans, and Mr. Goldthread listened as Regina’s<br/>mother repeatedly played an S-O-S on the bell for Mietzie’s room. Then<br/>they heard the slap of bare feet and there came running into the room,<br/>breathing hard, Mietzie followed by Chevalier and Queenie. “Regina!<br/>Where is she? She called me on the bells. She is in trouble.” Mietzie<br/>blurted out.</p><p>“It was me Princess,” Regina’s Mother said. “We don’t know where Regina<br/>is or what is going on. I think she sent a message in that code you two<br/>used to use, but I can’t read it. Except for this emergency call.”<br/>Regina’s Mother thrust the stationary sheet at Mietzie while pointing to<br/>the decorative edging. “There. What does it say?”</p><p>“I can’t read it,” Mietzie said, “I can only hear it.” She thrust the<br/>card back at Regina’s mother. “Play more of it. Short bells little<br/>circles. Long bells big circles.” Hans took the card and held it so that<br/>Regina’s mother could see, and Regina’s mother began to ring the bell<br/>while Mietzie intoned slowly “J-i-m-m-i-e s-p-y” Regina’s mother gasped<br/>and stopped ringing. René immediately left the room and two more guards<br/>appeared to take his place.</p><p>“More,” said Hans. Regina’s mother resumed her ringing. Mietzie said<br/>“A-n-d-a-l-o-n-i-a”</p><p>“That’s it. That’s the end of the loop.” Regina’s mother said.</p><p>The two new Swiss Guards turned an about face and left. Mr. Goldthread<br/>stood in the door. “Andalonia,” he said “Order the borders sealed. I<br/>will go tell her Majesty.”</p><p>“No need. I am here.” And Mr. Goldthread turned around to see the Queen<br/>behind him and Albrecht standing behind her. The Queen strode past Mr.<br/>Goldthread and gave Mietzie a tight bear hug. “Well done little one.<br/>Well done.” Then turning to Regina’s mother, “What a mistake we have all<br/>made wasting your time and talents on cleaning. Brilliant. Just<br/>Brilliant. Well. How do we find Regina?”</p><p>Albrecht spoke up. “I have been talking to Willie. I think it likely<br/>that Jimmie and the woman Head Mistress have her. I have sent word for<br/>the school to be searched.”</p><p>“Andalonia?” the Queen asked turning towards Mr. Goldthread.</p><p>“I think not Your Majesty. It is quite likely that an Ambassador would<br/>pay for information, but kidnapping little girls would be more than they<br/>would bargain for. I don’t think Jimmie will turn out to be an<br/>Andalonian spy, but rather a mercenary looking to sell information to<br/>the highest bidder. In this case it was Andalonia. Andalonia will<br/>disavow all knowledge of the agent. But there are probably more<br/>malevolent forces backing Jimmie.”</p><p>“Well we will still expel that Ambassador!” the Queen said angrily.</p><p>“I would be very surprised if he had not already left your Majesty. The<br/>Andalonians are not ethical, but they are clever, and given to<br/>self-preservation.”</p><p>The Queen harrumphed in response.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread continued. “In fact your Majesty, I think we will need to<br/>refrain from commenting officially on any these events when the<br/>Andalonians announce a replacement for ’health reasons’.”</p><p>The Queen glowered, but she did not dispute. “But what about Regina?”</p><p>“Albrecht,” Mr. Goldthread asked. “if you were a criminal abandoned by<br/>your sponsor and trapped in the realm with one of her agents what would<br/>you do?”</p><p>Albrecht looked at his mother when he said, “I would keep my prisoner<br/>alive to bargain, and then I would head for the one place where I knew<br/>they would not cooperate with my Mother.”</p><p>When Mr. Goldthread nodded, the room intoned together “Ost<br/>Hinterlandia.”</p><p>There was silence. Albrecht looked at his Mother, the Queen. “Mother?”<br/>She met his stare, and then nodded, “But not alone boy. Not alone.”<br/>Albrecht nodded at her, raised an eyebrow at the Swiss Guard Hans, who<br/>smiled in return, and then two spun on their heels and ran from the<br/>room.</p>
