They paused at<br/>the street and looked both ways.</p><p>“Where’s the stable?” Jimmie grunted.</p><p>“That way,” Miss Bostick indicated with her finger and then began to<br/>walk in that direction.</p><p>At the stable door Miss Bostick began to pound with her fist while<br/>shouting for the Stable Master to open. “Help! Emergency!” Miss Bostick<br/>glanced over at Jimmie who nodded. They could hear the fumbling from<br/>inside and soon one of the two large stable doors swung open far enough<br/>for a man to exit in nightcap and shirt.</p><p>“What’s all the racket? What’s going on?” the Stable Master asked<br/>obviously sleepy and confused.</p><p>“Here,” Jimmie said, swinging around ’Gina’s body in a sort of gesture.<br/>Her arm with the injured finger dangled and dripped blood into the<br/>street.</p><p>“Oh my goodness!” said the Stable Master now awake. “Is that one of the<br/>girls from the school? What happened?”</p><p>“Yes, but there’s no time for that now. We must get her to a doctor.”<br/>Jimmie transferred ’Gina, unconscious, to Miss Bostick, and walked to<br/>the Stable Master as if he had something to show him, and when the<br/>Stable Master bent forward to look Jimmie darted forward punching him in<br/>the stomach. There was an ’oof’ of escaping air. Without breaking his<br/>stride Jimmie turned the man around, grabbed his night shirt at the<br/>waist and neck, and propelled him through the open door of the stable.<br/>There was another ’oof’ and a crash of something striking wood. Jimmie<br/>turned around, “Hurry,“ he hissed.</p><p>Miss Bostick followed him into the stable and then two male figures<br/>appeared from nearby shadows and also walked in, the last one pulling<br/>the stable door closed behind him. Rapidly a horse was hitched to a<br/>small cart and ’Gina placed in the back with an old canvas tarp thrown<br/>across her. Miss Bostick and Jimmie climbed up, and Jimmie turned to the<br/>two men. “You understand? First the job! Then travel separately to the<br/>rendezvous. Bosty and me will take the Royal Road, you two will have to<br/>make your own way. We want three different trails for them to follow,<br/>got it? But first the job or there will be … Well, you know what will<br/>happen don’t you Gents? Alright. With any luck we’ll be toasting our<br/>good fortune in Hinterlandia. Now get that door open.” Jimmie clicked<br/>the reins and their dogcart began it’s slow clattering exit from the<br/>city appearing like just a farmer couple on their way home from market.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina found herself in thought, idle, meandering thought, before she<br/>realized she was awake. This unappreciated transition, allowed her to<br/>keep still as the realization of what had happened, and the pain, came<br/>to her slowly. Light diffused through the canvas and she felt the rock<br/>of a carriage. ’Gina deduced she was being taken somewhere. Why had they<br/>taken her? Did they still hope to get information from her? If so, it<br/>seemed strange to steal her from the school where everyone would notice<br/>the missing girl and question what had happened. And Helene. Surely she<br/>would sound an alarm.</p><p>’Gina felt groggy and nauseous. She was very thirsty, but she was afraid<br/>to speak or move. ’Gina laid very still listening to the snatches of<br/>conversation the driver and a passenger were having.</p><p>“What happened to her Jimmie? Did she faint?”</p><p>“That’s what I thought at first. She swooned. But no. It was pretty<br/>obvious pretty quick that it wasn’t just a faint. She would have revived<br/>long ago. She must have taken something before we got in her room.”</p><p>“Why would she do that?”</p><p>“Because she’s smart. Smarter than you that’s for sure. Harboring a<br/>Queen’s spy in your damn school for weeks. You think you’re so clever<br/>Bosty. Well that girl played you, and you didn’t even know it. You know<br/>I always liked her. She wasn’t spoiled like those damn brats of the<br/>Queen. I almost felt bad cutting off her finger. You know, I taught her<br/>how to throw a knife?</p><p>“No. She took something. Probably something she got from them guards the<br/>Queen has. I never got close to them. Too cautious. Too dangerous, but I<br/>seen them practicing some times, and you hear things. I once seen Franz<br/>coming out of the Swiss Guards barracks looking like he had had one too<br/>many at the pub. I bet they got some sort of fancy Swiss knock out drop.<br/>Probably meant for you, but that damn girl is so smart, ahh I can’t help<br/>liking her, she knew we were coming for her, and figured the only way to<br/>keep from giving in is if she wasn’t conscious. Damn smart. Did you keep<br/>that bit of her finger? I think I might like it for a keepsake.”</p><p>There was a snort of disgust, but apparently she Miss Bostick had kept<br/>the bit of finger, because there was no more said on that subject.<br/>Instead, Miss Bostick pressed on trying to clear up her own confusion.<br/>“But why Jimmie? Why was she there? And why is she here? Why did you<br/>take her instead of leaving or her or just killing her? She knows all<br/>about both of us.”</p><p>“Everyone knows all about both of us now. Killing her wouldn’t change<br/>that, but with her missing there will be a lot of distraction. The Queen<br/>looks on her like another daughter. Everyone of the staff heard talk of<br/>her. You know her name isn’t ’Gina. That’s just a bit of Regina, which<br/>means Queen, ’cause she was like a little Queen all to herself<br/>downstairs. With her missing the Queen will send every guard in the<br/>castle scouring the countryside. That means fewer of them looking for<br/>us, or finding us if they do”</p><p>’Gina listened from under her canvas. It did not make sense to her. Why<br/>not kill her or leave her? There would have been no purpose for the<br/>former, but simple revenge. However, Jimmie seemed like the person to<br/>view revenge as a principle of sufficient reason. She did not really<br/>believe she was alive and kidnapped because Jimmie liked her. And taking<br/>her with them merely slowed them down, gave them weight, and gave them<br/>trouble when she woke up. If she <b>woke up</b> they would assume she would<br/>scream and make trouble. Then they would have to kill her, so why not<br/>have done it at the start? What had they said? ’Gina’s head twitched a<br/>bit as she took up her usual attitude of thinking. It was murky, but she<br/>tried to remember what they had said, all the guards and troops would be<br/>sent to look for her. Why would Jimmie want more people looking for him?</p><p>’Gina felt her hand throb, her throat ached with thirst, and her muscles<br/>cramped from their frozen positions. Her hip seemed to be numb from the<br/>pressure of her unchanging posture. And then all these simple sensory<br/>sensations seemed to melt when she departed to a world of deeper thought<br/>where the only struggle was with her problem. Why would Jimmie want more<br/>people following? When she made no progress she tried to invert the<br/>problem. More in one place meant less in another. Jimmie did not want<br/>more following them, he wanted less at the castle. He took her to decoy<br/>the Guards away from the real threat. The Queen! The Queen must be in<br/>danger. Jimmie did not care about her. She was simply a feint meant to<br/>draw a response. They did not care what she knew or what she told. She<br/>had in fact already done as much work for them as they wanted. She had<br/>gone missing. And following this logical chain ’Gina concluded that her<br/>living value to Jimmie was rapidly dwindling. She still might prove a<br/>bargaining chip in a show down, so no pressing need to kill her, but<br/>very little reason to keep her alive either. By the same token there was<br/>little reason to keep her with them in any case. She had served her<br/>principal function. If she ran they would have little reason to follow<br/>her. Returning to the world of aches and pains she tried to ever so<br/>slightly stretch and adjust. Timing her movements to some particular<br/>bounce or shift in the cart as it struck a rut or the horse mis-stepped.<br/>Then, committed, she counted to three, threw back the tarp, and made<br/>blindly a wild leap from the back of the cart. It was an uncoordinated<br/>stiff hurdle, and she immediately stumbled falling into a dusty pile on<br/>the road.</p><p>“Whoa!” Jimmie pulled back hard on the reins, and turned his head. Miss<br/>Bostick had half risen in preparation for turning around to follow her.<br/>For a moment, the three met eyes and then ’Gina slowly inched her good<br/>right hand for her boot. Her movements seemed unusually slow and clumsy,<br/>but Jimmie immediately deduced what she was doing. “Did you search her?”<br/>he yelled at Miss Bostick, but he did not wait for Miss Bostick to<br/>answer. Jimmie yelled “Heeyah!” He snapped the reins while ducking and<br/>tugging at Miss Bostick who fell into the empty open bed of the cart.<br/>The cart began to slowly pick up speed. “Yes, you oaf! Of course I did.<br/>She doesn’t have a knife.” Miss Bostick berated Jimmie awkwardly from<br/>her upside down, skirt over her head, position in the bed of the cart.</p><p>Jimmie began to laugh, “I told you I liked that girl. What a bluff. Come<br/>on.” And he reached back to pull Miss Bostick back into her seat beside<br/>him.</p><p>“Shall we go after her?”</p><p>“No. She’ll just give them a new trail to follow, and that will divide<br/>them further. Plus, what is she going to do? Run all the way back to the<br/>castle. And do it not even knowing where she is? No. She can’t do<br/>nothing to us now, and besides, you want me to kill her just for<br/>nothing? I told you. I like that girl. She’s smart and got character.”</p><p>“Jimmie. You are too damn sentimental and soft-hearted.”</p><p>“I know. But that’s why you love me.” And Miss Bostick punctuated his<br/>statement by punching him hard in his shoulder and he laughed and howled<br/>in reply.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not wait to see how long her bluff bought her. As soon as she<br/>saw the cart move forward she turned and ran back in the opposite<br/>direction. Her logic was simple: wherever Jimmie and Miss Bostick where<br/>going was likely to be the exact opposite of wherever it was she wanted<br/>to go.</p><p>’Gina ran for several minutes, and then walked for several more. Her<br/>strength regained, she would trot for a bit, until too tired. The cycle<br/>repeated. Her hand throbbed, and she ached for a drink of water. But she<br/>denied all those physical distractions, and kept on with her purpose to<br/>warn the Queen. She must warn the Queen. For all her denial she could<br/>not now ignore the practical problem that confronted her: a crossroads.<br/>Did she go straight or did she turn, and if so which way. She saw some<br/>dust down one branch and ran toward it. She vaguely remembered some<br/>digression of Monsieur Franz’s: a single observation can be an unbiased<br/>estimator. If she wanted the busiest road, presuming the one to town and<br/>castle should have the most traffic, then she should take the first<br/>branch on which she could see a rider. As she came near him, she<br/>shouted, “Is this the road to town? To the Queen’s castle?”</p><p>The rider yelled back “Aye,” and then pulled up as he got a look at the<br/>dusty well dressed young maid running towards him. “Are you alright<br/>child?”</p><p>“No. I must warn the Queen. A plot. A plot.”</p><p>The rider looked at her with a puzzled look. She fit no conception of<br/>his. She appeared neither bumpkin nor aristocrat. Too young. Too dirty.<br/>Too polite. Too well dressed. Too odd.</p><p>“May I have some water please?” The rider pointed behind him and said,<br/>“Stream.” Then unable to wrap his thinking about the contradictions that<br/>confronted him he resumed his trot forward. ’Gina allowed herself one<br/>frustrated stamp of the foot, and then began her trot along the way he<br/>had come.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not know how long she had been trotting. An hour? She had<br/>drunk heavily at the small stream at the foot bridge crossing, but she<br/>had had nothing to bring water with her. She was very thirsty again. She<br/>had met two further small groups of travelers who were too stunned by<br/>her appearance to speak to her at all. She did get them to acknowledge<br/>by gesture that this was a road that led to town, but no more. Her hand<br/>had begun to bleed again, and she had bound it in a strip of her dress,<br/>but she could see the dark stain spreading further on the surface of the<br/>cloth.</p><p>It was no longer possible for her to alternate running and walking. Now<br/>she only walked and it was with a slow steady trudge that she<br/>determinedly made her way. She thought with each step. “The Queen. The<br/>Queen.” The cadence of her steps and thoughts kept a rhythm of progress,<br/>and each step reminded her and motivated her. She could also recognize<br/>that this was probably not a very healthy state she was in, and that she<br/>ought to stop. But each time that thought appeared it was blotted out by<br/>the next mental repetition of “The Queen,” and her resolve was renewed<br/>for another step.</p><p>She saw a distant cloud of dust. More riders. But again they were going<br/>the wrong way. Coming towards her. Did no one ever go to town! ’Gina was<br/>angry. She was exhausted. Someone had to help her get to the town.<br/>Someone had to help her get to the town! She felt like she was screaming<br/>this, but in fact she was just standing still in the middle of the road,<br/>and as the cloud gradually materialized into riders riding hard. ’Gina<br/>sat in the middle of the road hoping that this would force at least one<br/>of them to stop.</p><p>She recognized the colors before she recognized the men. Red and white.<br/>Swiss Guards, and then the funny feathered officer’s cap that Albrecht<br/>wore. A nest of horses reared and stomped around her sitting form. She<br/>saw Albrecht then, his face close to hers. His face was caked in red<br/>dust, as, but she did not know it, was hers; though hers was also<br/>streaked through by trails of sweat and blood.</p><p>“’Gina! My God. How wonderful, but how?” It was Albrecht’s voice. At<br/>least she believed it was his voice. Had she finally met help? Was it a<br/>mirage or some other clumsy trick of the brain? Hans appeared beside<br/>Albrecht, and another twenty or so horsemen with shiny weapons pranced<br/>about. “Jimmie, and Miss Bostick have fled.” ’Gina said. “They are going<br/>to Hinterlandia. No wait!” She stood as she yelled this, because Hans<br/>had turned to remount. “It’s a trick or something. The Queen is in<br/>danger.”</p><p>“What?” Hans had jumped back down and stood before her.</p><p>“Water, please.” ’Gina rasped. In between gulps she told them that she<br/>believed that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had taken her to lure away the<br/>Queen’s Guards. ’Gina thought there was a plot of some sort. ’Gina could<br/>not say exactly what it was, but she believed it to be true. Would they<br/>believe her? ’Gina argued. She must get back to the castle as quickly as<br/>possible. The way that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had spoken ’Gina feared<br/>the plot could be imminent. Today. Now. There could be no delay. She had<br/>become emphatic and the guards on horseback who did not know her like<br/>Albrecht and Hans could not hide smiles as they watched this young girl<br/>demand compliance from the Prince and a commander of the Swiss Guards.</p><p>Albrecht turned to Hans. “What should we do do you think?”</p><p>Hans opened his mouth to speak, but then seemed to reflect. He turned<br/>back to Albrecht and said in a calm and respectful tone. “What do you<br/>command my Prince?”</p><p>If Albrecht was surprised by this transition from commanded to commander<br/>he did not show it. He looked first up the road in the direction from<br/>which ’Gina had come, and then back in the direction of the castle. His<br/>horseman’s mind was calculating time and distance. He surveyed the<br/>horses and walked among them,and tapped the necks of four horses. “You<br/>men dismount.” He turned to Hans. “If you and ’Gina each sit the same<br/>horse, trail the others riderless, and change to the next when the first<br/>one becomes exhausted you will be able to ride at a gallop all the way<br/>to the castle. I will take the others, and we will double up as we go<br/>after Miss Bostick and Jimmie.”</p><p>Hans made a slight bow to Albrecht, who then turned and mounted. The<br/>four guards on the ground mounted behind four of their fellows and<br/>trotted after. Meanwhile Hans grabbed the reins of all the free horses.<br/>He leaped to the saddle of one, pulled ’Gina up behind him, and they<br/>raced at a gallop toward the castle.</p></root><a href="chapter15.html">Prior Chapter …—…</a><p><a href="chapter17.html">Next Chapter Another Tea</a></p></body></html>
