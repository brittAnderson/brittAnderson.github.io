They paused at the street and looked both ways.</p><p>“Where’s the stable?” Jimmie grunted.</p><p>“That way,” Miss Bostick indicated with her finger and then began to walk in that direction.</p><p>At the stable door Miss Bostick began to pound with her fist while shouting for the Stable Master to open. “Help! Emergency!” Miss Bostick glanced over at Jimmie who nodded. They could hear the fumbling from inside and soon one of the two large stable doors swung open far enough for a man to exit in nightcap and shirt.</p><p>“What’s all the racket? What’s going on?” the Stable Master asked obviously sleepy and confused.</p><p>“Here,” Jimmie said, swinging around ’Gina’s body in a sort of gesture. Her arm with the injured finger dangled and dripped blood into the street.</p><p>“Oh my goodness!” said the Stable Master now awake. “Is that one of the girls from the school? What happened?”</p><p>“Yes, but there’s no time for that now. We must get her to a doctor.” Jimmie transferred ’Gina, unconscious, to Miss Bostick, and walked to the Stable Master as if he had something to show him, and when the Stable Master bent forward to look Jimmie darted forward punching him in the stomach. There was an ’oof’ of escaping air. Without breaking his stride Jimmie turned the man around, grabbed his night shirt at the waist and neck, and propelled him through the open door of the stable. There was another ’oof’ and a crash of something striking wood. Jimmie turned around, “Hurry,“ he hissed.</p><p>Miss Bostick followed him into the stable and then two male figures appeared from nearby shadows and also walked in, the last one pulling the stable door closed behind him. Rapidly a horse was hitched to a small cart and ’Gina placed in the back with an old canvas tarp thrown across her. Miss Bostick and Jimmie climbed up, and Jimmie turned to the two men. “You understand? First the job! Then travel separately to the rendezvous. Bosty and me will take the Royal Road, you two will have to make your own way. We want three different trails for them to follow, got it? But first the job or there will be … Well, you know what will happen don’t you Gents? Alright. With any luck we’ll be toasting our good fortune in Hinterlandia. Now get that door open.” Jimmie clicked the reins and their dogcart began it’s slow clattering exit from the city appearing like just a farmer couple on their way home from market.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina found herself in thought, idle, meandering thought, before she realized she was awake. This unappreciated transition, allowed her to keep still as the realization of what had happened, and the pain, came to her slowly. Light diffused through the canvas and she felt the rock of a carriage. ’Gina deduced she was being taken somewhere. Why had they taken her? Did they still hope to get information from her? If so, it seemed strange to steal her from the school where everyone would notice the missing girl and question what had happened. And Helene. Surely she would sound an alarm.</p><p>’Gina felt groggy and nauseous. She was very thirsty, but she was afraid to speak or move. ’Gina laid very still listening to the snatches of conversation the driver and a passenger were having.</p><p>“What happened to her Jimmie? Did she faint?”</p><p>“That’s what I thought at first. She swooned. But no. It was pretty obvious pretty quick that it wasn’t just a faint. She would have revived long ago. She must have taken something before we got in her room.”</p><p>“Why would she do that?”</p><p>“Because she’s smart. Smarter than you that’s for sure. Harboring a Queen’s spy in your damn school for weeks. You think you’re so clever Bosty. Well that girl played you, and you didn’t even know it. You know I always liked her. She wasn’t spoiled like those damn brats of the Queen. I almost felt bad cutting off her finger. You know, I taught her how to throw a knife?</p><p>“No. She took something. Probably something she got from them guards the Queen has. I never got close to them. Too cautious. Too dangerous, but I seen them practicing some times, and you hear things. I once seen Franz coming out of the Swiss Guards barracks looking like he had had one too many at the pub. I bet they got some sort of fancy Swiss knock out drop. Probably meant for you, but that damn girl is so smart, ahh I can’t help liking her, she knew we were coming for her, and figured the only way to keep from giving in is if she wasn’t conscious. Damn smart. Did you keep that bit of her finger? I think I might like it for a keepsake.”</p><p>There was a snort of disgust, but apparently she Miss Bostick had kept the bit of finger, because there was no more said on that subject. Instead, Miss Bostick pressed on trying to clear up her own confusion. “But why Jimmie? Why was she there? And why is she here? Why did you take her instead of leaving or her or just killing her? She knows all about both of us.”</p><p>“Everyone knows all about both of us now. Killing her wouldn’t change that, but with her missing there will be a lot of distraction. The Queen looks on her like another daughter. Everyone of the staff heard talk of her. You know her name isn’t ’Gina. That’s just a bit of Regina, which means Queen, ’cause she was like a little Queen all to herself downstairs. With her missing the Queen will send every guard in the castle scouring the countryside. That means fewer of them looking for us, or finding us if they do”</p><p>’Gina listened from under her canvas. It did not make sense to her. Why not kill her or leave her? There would have been no purpose for the former, but simple revenge. However, Jimmie seemed like the person to view revenge as a principle of sufficient reason. She did not really believe she was alive and kidnapped because Jimmie liked her. And taking her with them merely slowed them down, gave them weight, and gave them trouble when she woke up. If she <b>woke up</b> they would assume she would scream and make trouble. Then they would have to kill her, so why not have done it at the start? What had they said? ’Gina’s head twitched a bit as she took up her usual attitude of thinking. It was murky, but she tried to remember what they had said, all the guards and troops would be sent to look for her. Why would Jimmie want more people looking for him?</p><p>’Gina felt her hand throb, her throat ached with thirst, and her muscles cramped from their frozen positions. Her hip seemed to be numb from the pressure of her unchanging posture. And then all these simple sensory sensations seemed to melt when she departed to a world of deeper thought where the only struggle was with her problem. Why would Jimmie want more people following? When she made no progress she tried to invert the problem. More in one place meant less in another. Jimmie did not want more following them, he wanted less at the castle. He took her to decoy the Guards away from the real threat. The Queen! The Queen must be in danger. Jimmie did not care about her. She was simply a feint meant to draw a response. They did not care what she knew or what she told. She had in fact already done as much work for them as they wanted. She had gone missing. And following this logical chain ’Gina concluded that her living value to Jimmie was rapidly dwindling. She still might prove a bargaining chip in a show down, so no pressing need to kill her, but very little reason to keep her alive either. By the same token there was little reason to keep her with them in any case. She had served her principal function. If she ran they would have little reason to follow her. Returning to the world of aches and pains she tried to ever so slightly stretch and adjust. Timing her movements to some particular bounce or shift in the cart as it struck a rut or the horse mis-stepped. Then, committed, she counted to three, threw back the tarp, and made blindly a wild leap from the back of the cart. It was an uncoordinated stiff hurdle, and she immediately stumbled falling into a dusty pile on the road.</p><p>“Whoa!” Jimmie pulled back hard on the reins, and turned his head. Miss Bostick had half risen in preparation for turning around to follow her. For a moment, the three met eyes and then ’Gina slowly inched her good right hand for her boot. Her movements seemed unusually slow and clumsy, but Jimmie immediately deduced what she was doing. “Did you search her?” he yelled at Miss Bostick, but he did not wait for Miss Bostick to answer. Jimmie yelled “Heeyah!” He snapped the reins while ducking and tugging at Miss Bostick who fell into the empty open bed of the cart. The cart began to slowly pick up speed. “Yes, you oaf! Of course I did. She doesn’t have a knife.” Miss Bostick berated Jimmie awkwardly from her upside down, skirt over her head, position in the bed of the cart.</p><p>Jimmie began to laugh, “I told you I liked that girl. What a bluff. Come on.” And he reached back to pull Miss Bostick back into her seat beside him.</p><p>“Shall we go after her?”</p><p>“No. She’ll just give them a new trail to follow, and that will divide them further. Plus, what is she going to do? Run all the way back to the castle. And do it not even knowing where she is? No. She can’t do nothing to us now, and besides, you want me to kill her just for nothing? I told you. I like that girl. She’s smart and got character.”</p><p>“Jimmie. You are too damn sentimental and soft-hearted.”</p><p>“I know. But that’s why you love me.” And Miss Bostick punctuated his statement by punching him hard in his shoulder and he laughed and howled in reply.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not wait to see how long her bluff bought her. As soon as she saw the cart move forward she turned and ran back in the opposite direction. Her logic was simple: wherever Jimmie and Miss Bostick where going was likely to be the exact opposite of wherever it was she wanted to go.</p><p>’Gina ran for several minutes, and then walked for several more. Her strength regained, she would trot for a bit, until too tired. The cycle repeated. Her hand throbbed, and she ached for a drink of water. But she denied all those physical distractions, and kept on with her purpose to warn the Queen. She must warn the Queen. For all her denial she could not now ignore the practical problem that confronted her: a crossroads. Did she go straight or did she turn, and if so which way. She saw some dust down one branch and ran toward it. She vaguely remembered some digression of Monsieur Franz’s: a single observation can be an unbiased estimator. If she wanted the busiest road, presuming the one to town and castle should have the most traffic, then she should take the first branch on which she could see a rider. As she came near him, she shouted, “Is this the road to town? To the Queen’s castle?”</p><p>The rider yelled back “Aye,” and then pulled up as he got a look at the dusty well dressed young maid running towards him. “Are you alright child?”</p><p>“No. I must warn the Queen. A plot. A plot.”</p><p>The rider looked at her with a puzzled look. She fit no conception of his. She appeared neither bumpkin nor aristocrat. Too young. Too dirty. Too polite. Too well dressed. Too odd.</p><p>“May I have some water please?” The rider pointed behind him and said, “Stream.” Then unable to wrap his thinking about the contradictions that confronted him he resumed his trot forward. ’Gina allowed herself one frustrated stamp of the foot, and then began her trot along the way he had come.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not know how long she had been trotting. An hour? She had drunk heavily at the small stream at the foot bridge crossing, but she had had nothing to bring water with her. She was very thirsty again. She had met two further small groups of travelers who were too stunned by her appearance to speak to her at all. She did get them to acknowledge by gesture that this was a road that led to town, but no more. Her hand had begun to bleed again, and she had bound it in a strip of her dress, but she could see the dark stain spreading further on the surface of the cloth.</p><p>It was no longer possible for her to alternate running and walking. Now she only walked and it was with a slow steady trudge that she determinedly made her way. She thought with each step. “The Queen. The Queen.” The cadence of her steps and thoughts kept a rhythm of progress, and each step reminded her and motivated her. She could also recognize that this was probably not a very healthy state she was in, and that she ought to stop. But each time that thought appeared it was blotted out by the next mental repetition of “The Queen,” and her resolve was renewed for another step.</p><p>She saw a distant cloud of dust. More riders. But again they were going the wrong way. Coming towards her. Did no one ever go to town! ’Gina was angry. She was exhausted. Someone had to help her get to the town. Someone had to help her get to the town! She felt like she was screaming this, but in fact she was just standing still in the middle of the road, and as the cloud gradually materialized into riders riding hard. ’Gina sat in the middle of the road hoping that this would force at least one of them to stop.</p><p>She recognized the colors before she recognized the men. Red and white. Swiss Guards, and then the funny feathered officer’s cap that Albrecht wore. A nest of horses reared and stomped around her sitting form. She saw Albrecht then, his face close to hers. His face was caked in red dust, as, but she did not know it, was hers; though hers was also streaked through by trails of sweat and blood.</p><p>“’Gina! My God. How wonderful, but how?” It was Albrecht’s voice. At least she believed it was his voice. Had she finally met help? Was it a mirage or some other clumsy trick of the brain? Hans appeared beside Albrecht, and another twenty or so horsemen with shiny weapons pranced about. “Jimmie, and Miss Bostick have fled.” ’Gina said. “They are going to Hinterlandia. No wait!” She stood as she yelled this, because Hans had turned to remount. “It’s a trick or something. The Queen is in danger.”</p><p>“What?” Hans had jumped back down and stood before her.</p><p>“Water, please.” ’Gina rasped. In between gulps she told them that she believed that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had taken her to lure away the Queen’s Guards. ’Gina thought there was a plot of some sort. ’Gina could not say exactly what it was, but she believed it to be true. Would they believe her? ’Gina argued. She must get back to the castle as quickly as possible. The way that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had spoken ’Gina feared the plot could be imminent. Today. Now. There could be no delay. She had become emphatic and the guards on horseback who did not know her like Albrecht and Hans could not hide smiles as they watched this young girl demand compliance from the Prince and a commander of the Swiss Guards.</p><p>Albrecht turned to Hans. “What should we do do you think?”</p><p>Hans opened his mouth to speak, but then seemed to reflect. He turned back to Albrecht and said in a calm and respectful tone. “What do you command my Prince?”</p><p>If Albrecht was surprised by this transition from commanded to commander he did not show it. He looked first up the road in the direction from which ’Gina had come, and then back in the direction of the castle. His horseman’s mind was calculating time and distance. He surveyed the horses and walked among them,and tapped the necks of four horses. “You men dismount.” He turned to Hans. “If you and ’Gina each sit the same horse, trail the others riderless, and change to the next when the first one becomes exhausted you will be able to ride at a gallop all the way to the castle. I will take the others, and we will double up as we go after Miss Bostick and Jimmie.”</p><p>Hans made a slight bow to Albrecht, who then turned and mounted. The four guards on the ground mounted behind four of their fellows and trotted after. Meanwhile Hans grabbed the reins of all the free horses. He leaped to the saddle of one, pulled ’Gina up behind him, and they raced at a gallop toward the castle.</p></root><a href="chapter15.html">Prior Chapter …—…</a><p><a href="chapter17.html">Next Chapter Another Tea</a></p></body></html>
