They paused atthe street and looked both ways.</p><p>“Where’s the stable?” Jimmie grunted.</p><p>“That way,” Miss Bostick indicated with her finger and then began towalk in that direction.</p><p>At the stable door Miss Bostick began to pound with her fist whileshouting for the Stable Master to open. “Help! Emergency!” Miss Bostickglanced over at Jimmie who nodded. They could hear the fumbling frominside and soon one of the two large stable doors swung open far enoughfor a man to exit in nightcap and shirt.</p><p>“What’s all the racket? What’s going on?” the Stable Master askedobviously sleepy and confused.</p><p>“Here,” Jimmie said, swinging around ’Gina’s body in a sort of gesture.Her arm with the injured finger dangled and dripped blood into thestreet.</p><p>“Oh my goodness!” said the Stable Master now awake. “Is that one of thegirls from the school? What happened?”</p><p>“Yes, but there’s no time for that now. We must get her to a doctor.”Jimmie transferred ’Gina, unconscious, to Miss Bostick, and walked tothe Stable Master as if he had something to show him, and when theStable Master bent forward to look Jimmie darted forward punching him inthe stomach. There was an ’oof’ of escaping air. Without breaking hisstride Jimmie turned the man around, grabbed his night shirt at thewaist and neck, and propelled him through the open door of the stable.There was another ’oof’ and a crash of something striking wood. Jimmieturned around, “Hurry,“ he hissed.</p><p>Miss Bostick followed him into the stable and then two male figuresappeared from nearby shadows and also walked in, the last one pullingthe stable door closed behind him. Rapidly a horse was hitched to asmall cart and ’Gina placed in the back with an old canvas tarp thrownacross her. Miss Bostick and Jimmie climbed up, and Jimmie turned to thetwo men. “You understand? First the job! Then travel separately to therendezvous. Bosty and me will take the Royal Road, you two will have tomake your own way. We want three different trails for them to follow,got it? But first the job or there will be … Well, you know what willhappen don’t you Gents? Alright. With any luck we’ll be toasting ourgood fortune in Hinterlandia. Now get that door open.” Jimmie clickedthe reins and their dogcart began it’s slow clattering exit from thecity appearing like just a farmer couple on their way home from market.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina found herself in thought, idle, meandering thought, before sherealized she was awake. This unappreciated transition, allowed her tokeep still as the realization of what had happened, and the pain, cameto her slowly. Light diffused through the canvas and she felt the rockof a carriage. ’Gina deduced she was being taken somewhere. Why had theytaken her? Did they still hope to get information from her? If so, itseemed strange to steal her from the school where everyone would noticethe missing girl and question what had happened. And Helene. Surely shewould sound an alarm.</p><p>’Gina felt groggy and nauseous. She was very thirsty, but she was afraidto speak or move. ’Gina laid very still listening to the snatches ofconversation the driver and a passenger were having.</p><p>“What happened to her Jimmie? Did she faint?”</p><p>“That’s what I thought at first. She swooned. But no. It was prettyobvious pretty quick that it wasn’t just a faint. She would have revivedlong ago. She must have taken something before we got in her room.”</p><p>“Why would she do that?”</p><p>“Because she’s smart. Smarter than you that’s for sure. Harboring aQueen’s spy in your damn school for weeks. You think you’re so cleverBosty. Well that girl played you, and you didn’t even know it. You knowI always liked her. She wasn’t spoiled like those damn brats of theQueen. I almost felt bad cutting off her finger. You know, I taught herhow to throw a knife?</p><p>“No. She took something. Probably something she got from them guards theQueen has. I never got close to them. Too cautious. Too dangerous, but Iseen them practicing some times, and you hear things. I once seen Franzcoming out of the Swiss Guards barracks looking like he had had one toomany at the pub. I bet they got some sort of fancy Swiss knock out drop.Probably meant for you, but that damn girl is so smart, ahh I can’t helpliking her, she knew we were coming for her, and figured the only way tokeep from giving in is if she wasn’t conscious. Damn smart. Did you keepthat bit of her finger? I think I might like it for a keepsake.”</p><p>There was a snort of disgust, but apparently she Miss Bostick had keptthe bit of finger, because there was no more said on that subject.Instead, Miss Bostick pressed on trying to clear up her own confusion.“But why Jimmie? Why was she there? And why is she here? Why did youtake her instead of leaving or her or just killing her? She knows allabout both of us.”</p><p>“Everyone knows all about both of us now. Killing her wouldn’t changethat, but with her missing there will be a lot of distraction. The Queenlooks on her like another daughter. Everyone of the staff heard talk ofher. You know her name isn’t ’Gina. That’s just a bit of Regina, whichmeans Queen, ’cause she was like a little Queen all to herselfdownstairs. With her missing the Queen will send every guard in thecastle scouring the countryside. That means fewer of them looking forus, or finding us if they do”</p><p>’Gina listened from under her canvas. It did not make sense to her. Whynot kill her or leave her? There would have been no purpose for theformer, but simple revenge. However, Jimmie seemed like the person toview revenge as a principle of sufficient reason. She did not reallybelieve she was alive and kidnapped because Jimmie liked her. And takingher with them merely slowed them down, gave them weight, and gave themtrouble when she woke up. If she <b>woke up</b> they would assume she wouldscream and make trouble. Then they would have to kill her, so why nothave done it at the start? What had they said? ’Gina’s head twitched abit as she took up her usual attitude of thinking. It was murky, but shetried to remember what they had said, all the guards and troops would besent to look for her. Why would Jimmie want more people looking for him?</p><p>’Gina felt her hand throb, her throat ached with thirst, and her musclescramped from their frozen positions. Her hip seemed to be numb from thepressure of her unchanging posture. And then all these simple sensorysensations seemed to melt when she departed to a world of deeper thoughtwhere the only struggle was with her problem. Why would Jimmie want morepeople following? When she made no progress she tried to invert theproblem. More in one place meant less in another. Jimmie did not wantmore following them, he wanted less at the castle. He took her to decoythe Guards away from the real threat. The Queen! The Queen must be indanger. Jimmie did not care about her. She was simply a feint meant todraw a response. They did not care what she knew or what she told. Shehad in fact already done as much work for them as they wanted. She hadgone missing. And following this logical chain ’Gina concluded that herliving value to Jimmie was rapidly dwindling. She still might prove abargaining chip in a show down, so no pressing need to kill her, butvery little reason to keep her alive either. By the same token there waslittle reason to keep her with them in any case. She had served herprincipal function. If she ran they would have little reason to followher. Returning to the world of aches and pains she tried to ever soslightly stretch and adjust. Timing her movements to some particularbounce or shift in the cart as it struck a rut or the horse mis-stepped.Then, committed, she counted to three, threw back the tarp, and madeblindly a wild leap from the back of the cart. It was an uncoordinatedstiff hurdle, and she immediately stumbled falling into a dusty pile onthe road.</p><p>“Whoa!” Jimmie pulled back hard on the reins, and turned his head. MissBostick had half risen in preparation for turning around to follow her.For a moment, the three met eyes and then ’Gina slowly inched her goodright hand for her boot. Her movements seemed unusually slow and clumsy,but Jimmie immediately deduced what she was doing. “Did you search her?”he yelled at Miss Bostick, but he did not wait for Miss Bostick toanswer. Jimmie yelled “Heeyah!” He snapped the reins while ducking andtugging at Miss Bostick who fell into the empty open bed of the cart.The cart began to slowly pick up speed. “Yes, you oaf! Of course I did.She doesn’t have a knife.” Miss Bostick berated Jimmie awkwardly fromher upside down, skirt over her head, position in the bed of the cart.</p><p>Jimmie began to laugh, “I told you I liked that girl. What a bluff. Comeon.” And he reached back to pull Miss Bostick back into her seat besidehim.</p><p>“Shall we go after her?”</p><p>“No. She’ll just give them a new trail to follow, and that will dividethem further. Plus, what is she going to do? Run all the way back to thecastle. And do it not even knowing where she is? No. She can’t donothing to us now, and besides, you want me to kill her just fornothing? I told you. I like that girl. She’s smart and got character.”</p><p>“Jimmie. You are too damn sentimental and soft-hearted.”</p><p>“I know. But that’s why you love me.” And Miss Bostick punctuated hisstatement by punching him hard in his shoulder and he laughed and howledin reply.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not wait to see how long her bluff bought her. As soon as shesaw the cart move forward she turned and ran back in the oppositedirection. Her logic was simple: wherever Jimmie and Miss Bostick wheregoing was likely to be the exact opposite of wherever it was she wantedto go.</p><p>’Gina ran for several minutes, and then walked for several more. Herstrength regained, she would trot for a bit, until too tired. The cyclerepeated. Her hand throbbed, and she ached for a drink of water. But shedenied all those physical distractions, and kept on with her purpose towarn the Queen. She must warn the Queen. For all her denial she couldnot now ignore the practical problem that confronted her: a crossroads.Did she go straight or did she turn, and if so which way. She saw somedust down one branch and ran toward it. She vaguely remembered somedigression of Monsieur Franz’s: a single observation can be an unbiasedestimator. If she wanted the busiest road, presuming the one to town andcastle should have the most traffic, then she should take the firstbranch on which she could see a rider. As she came near him, sheshouted, “Is this the road to town? To the Queen’s castle?”</p><p>The rider yelled back “Aye,” and then pulled up as he got a look at thedusty well dressed young maid running towards him. “Are you alrightchild?”</p><p>“No. I must warn the Queen. A plot. A plot.”</p><p>The rider looked at her with a puzzled look. She fit no conception ofhis. She appeared neither bumpkin nor aristocrat. Too young. Too dirty.Too polite. Too well dressed. Too odd.</p><p>“May I have some water please?” The rider pointed behind him and said,“Stream.” Then unable to wrap his thinking about the contradictions thatconfronted him he resumed his trot forward. ’Gina allowed herself onefrustrated stamp of the foot, and then began her trot along the way hehad come.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>’Gina did not know how long she had been trotting. An hour? She haddrunk heavily at the small stream at the foot bridge crossing, but shehad had nothing to bring water with her. She was very thirsty again. Shehad met two further small groups of travelers who were too stunned byher appearance to speak to her at all. She did get them to acknowledgeby gesture that this was a road that led to town, but no more. Her handhad begun to bleed again, and she had bound it in a strip of her dress,but she could see the dark stain spreading further on the surface of thecloth.</p><p>It was no longer possible for her to alternate running and walking. Nowshe only walked and it was with a slow steady trudge that shedeterminedly made her way. She thought with each step. “The Queen. TheQueen.” The cadence of her steps and thoughts kept a rhythm of progress,and each step reminded her and motivated her. She could also recognizethat this was probably not a very healthy state she was in, and that sheought to stop. But each time that thought appeared it was blotted out bythe next mental repetition of “The Queen,” and her resolve was renewedfor another step.</p><p>She saw a distant cloud of dust. More riders. But again they were goingthe wrong way. Coming towards her. Did no one ever go to town! ’Gina wasangry. She was exhausted. Someone had to help her get to the town.Someone had to help her get to the town! She felt like she was screamingthis, but in fact she was just standing still in the middle of the road,and as the cloud gradually materialized into riders riding hard. ’Ginasat in the middle of the road hoping that this would force at least oneof them to stop.</p><p>She recognized the colors before she recognized the men. Red and white.Swiss Guards, and then the funny feathered officer’s cap that Albrechtwore. A nest of horses reared and stomped around her sitting form. Shesaw Albrecht then, his face close to hers. His face was caked in reddust, as, but she did not know it, was hers; though hers was alsostreaked through by trails of sweat and blood.</p><p>“’Gina! My God. How wonderful, but how?” It was Albrecht’s voice. Atleast she believed it was his voice. Had she finally met help? Was it amirage or some other clumsy trick of the brain? Hans appeared besideAlbrecht, and another twenty or so horsemen with shiny weapons prancedabout. “Jimmie, and Miss Bostick have fled.” ’Gina said. “They are goingto Hinterlandia. No wait!” She stood as she yelled this, because Hanshad turned to remount. “It’s a trick or something. The Queen is indanger.”</p><p>“What?” Hans had jumped back down and stood before her.</p><p>“Water, please.” ’Gina rasped. In between gulps she told them that shebelieved that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had taken her to lure away theQueen’s Guards. ’Gina thought there was a plot of some sort. ’Gina couldnot say exactly what it was, but she believed it to be true. Would theybelieve her? ’Gina argued. She must get back to the castle as quickly aspossible. The way that Jimmie and Miss Bostick had spoken ’Gina fearedthe plot could be imminent. Today. Now. There could be no delay. She hadbecome emphatic and the guards on horseback who did not know her likeAlbrecht and Hans could not hide smiles as they watched this young girldemand compliance from the Prince and a commander of the Swiss Guards.</p><p>Albrecht turned to Hans. “What should we do do you think?”</p><p>Hans opened his mouth to speak, but then seemed to reflect. He turnedback to Albrecht and said in a calm and respectful tone. “What do youcommand my Prince?”</p><p>If Albrecht was surprised by this transition from commanded to commanderhe did not show it. He looked first up the road in the direction fromwhich ’Gina had come, and then back in the direction of the castle. Hishorseman’s mind was calculating time and distance. He surveyed thehorses and walked among them,and tapped the necks of four horses. “Youmen dismount.” He turned to Hans. “If you and ’Gina each sit the samehorse, trail the others riderless, and change to the next when the firstone becomes exhausted you will be able to ride at a gallop all the wayto the castle. I will take the others, and we will double up as we goafter Miss Bostick and Jimmie.”</p><p>Hans made a slight bow to Albrecht, who then turned and mounted. Thefour guards on the ground mounted behind four of their fellows andtrotted after. Meanwhile Hans grabbed the reins of all the free horses.He leaped to the saddle of one, pulled ’Gina up behind him, and theyraced at a gallop toward the castle.</p></root><a href="chapter15.html">Prior Chapter …—…</a><p><a href="chapter17.html">Next Chapter Another Tea</a></p></body></html>
