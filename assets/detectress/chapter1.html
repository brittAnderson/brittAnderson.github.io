There were two reasons for this: One, it was avery, very large palace; And two, there were two realms within thepalace. There was the lower realm. It was the servants’ world. It was awarren of pantries and sculleries; work shops and storage rooms; smallsleeping quarters; and deep and dark basements shuttered behind locked and rusting doors.</p><p><b>Almost</b> no one had been in all the rooms of the palace. But the Queenhad. She toured from top to bottom. She inspected. She observed. She didthis not only because it was <b>her</b> palace, but because it was also herfamily’s <b>home</b>, and it was her nation’s trust.</p><p>It was on one such tour day, unannounced and unexpected, that a youngchild was hurriedly shunted aside and instructed to amuse herself. Thechild was directed to a small side room with a small table, a room usedfor the occasional servant’s break. It was the room for a quick pipe ora cup of tea, a bit of gossip or a moan about one’s feet, a communalsigh or a shared weary silence. The child was given a stub of pencil anda large piece of butcher’s paper recently used, but mostly unsoiled, andcompletely dry. Such things were saved for the young girl. She was usedto being shunted aside and entertaining herself. Her mother’s life atthe Palace was a hard, busy and tiring one.</p><p>Absorbed in her art the young girl noticed neither the hush that felloutside the doorway nor the silhouette of the large figure that filledthat doorway, but she did look up when the figure passed inside thesmall room. The young girl cheerfully said, “Oh. Hello.”</p><p>The silhouette replied, “Hello to you. What are you doing, may I ask?”</p><p>“I am drawing a picture.” After her initial glance up the little girlhad lowered her head and her gaze back down. The little girl knew shemust answer grown-up questions politely, but her work was quiteabsorbing.</p><p>“Of what are you drawing a picture?” the tall silhouette asked.</p><p>“The Boss Lady who runs this place.”</p><p>“May I see her?”</p><p>The child sat up, and slid her drawing towards the older woman who nowleaned over the table to study it. The woman observed for a moment, andthen straightened up while asking: “Isn’t it unusual that the person inyour picture should be floating in the air when everyone else is on theground?”</p><p>“No. She’s a highness person.”</p><p>“Oh.” the older woman said, and strained to hide her smile. “That makessense. But why is she dressed that way?”</p><p>The dress of the figure in the drawing was not too easily seen, such wasthe young child’s art, but it was clear that it was large, black,severe, and, one could infer, uncomfortable.</p><p>The child replied, “Because she is mean.”</p><p>“She is is she?” The Queen’s feelings were not hurt. She knew that lifeas a servant, whether for the Queen or for other people, often led tothe occasional bitter feeling that would sour if not expressed. But theQueen had to suppress another smile when she reflected on the silenthousehold behind her in the hall listening to their conversation. TheQueen did not intend to prolong their discomfort, and was preparing toleave the child when she asked one last teasing question. “She lookslike me don’t you think?”</p><p>“No.” The child was emphatic. The strength of the rejection surprisedthe Queen. This Queen was not often surprised. She enjoyed the feeling.</p><p>“Why not? Because I am not a <b>highness</b>?” asked the Queen.</p><p>“No. Because you’re not mean. You’re nice.” And the young girl smiled ather.</p><p>“And you my dear are a very genuine and pleasant young lady with whom tospeak.”</p><p>The young girl beamed. She had never been called a lady before. Only theupstairs people were <b>ladies</b>. She jumped from her chair with a quickshout of “Mama” as a prelude to sharing the news. Then the young girlfroze. She realized suddenly that she had been speaking with an upstairsperson. The young girl grew afraid. When her moment of startle passedthe young girl ran out of the room to clutch the apron of a young womanwho had been standing quietly by, head bowed.</p><p>Her Majesty left the room with a quick word to the aide outside: “Grabthat picture.” The Queen followed the young girl to where she now stoodhalf hidden by her mother’s apron. With one curious eye the young girlstared back at the Queen.</p><p>The Queen addressed the young girl’s mother. “You have an exceptionalchild.” The young mother blushed, but did not otherwise move. “She isfour I would estimate?” There was a slight nod from the young mother.“When she is 10 I wish to see her again. Do you understand?” Anothershort nod, but now the expression changed to one of confusion. “Yes, Iknow it would not normally be easy, but this is my secretary Mr.Goldthread.” The Queen indicated the returning aide who held in his graygloved hands the butcher paper art neatly folded. “He has heard myinstructions. He will monitor your daughter’s progress and he will seeto the arrangements. You need only let your superiors know when it istime, and word will be passed to Mr. Goldthread. He will confirm thearrangements. Until then, please keep doing what you are doing, becauseas a mother you excel, and I know how hard that job is.Congratulations.”</p><p>A rustle passed through the silent, still staff. They found itincreasingly difficult to keep their excitement bottled up. The youngmother could not resist a quick breach of protocol and glanced upsmiling. She was met with a smiling glance down. It was a shared momentbetween mothers.</p><p>When the Queen finally passed through the last doorway that marked theborder between upstairs and downstairs, and when the echo of the lastlatch clicking shut echoed down the silent stairwell, there erupted inthe downstairs hall a loud Hurrah.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The household could now be said to have two Queens: an upstairs Queen -known as such to the world, and a downstairs’ Queen - one attentivelyserved by her mother, friends, and all the staff. The little girl hadalways been a favorite, but now became favored as well. She was allowedon late night inspections with valets who taught her the backpassageways and the little known routes for navigating the house. As shegrew the young girl was taught how the men and women of the upstairsdressed. She learned the names of the strange contents and devices thatcomprised the upstairs world, but were seldom seen below. Some days werekitchen days. On those days the young girl was instructed throughexposure and by example the right way to make preserves, cook geese,what make a scone worthy of the name, and how to recognize when thepudding is done by listening to the pitch of the hiss from the steamer.</p><p>The growing girl learned mathematics by checking accounts, which weredone by a former cleric, now atheist, who was also a happily marriedsecond butler. This cleric turned butler made teaching the little girlher ciphers his special project. She was a quick learner, and he soonmoved on to include reading and writing as part of her instruction. Thebutler asked a friend who still tended a parish for materials. Thefriend sent back a full set of worn, but legible, McGuffey readers.These gifts to the church would continue doing service in the downstairsof the Queen’s household. The girl loved the stories. She read througheach of them many times. Once she was done she would begin again. Shecould be heard roaming the halls or helping with the dusting while allthe time citing remembered passages from Virgil or the label of Puff’sBaking Powder. Obedience came naturally to one who wanted so much toplease. Even her diction was a subject for instruction. This wasaddressed by Mr. Goldthread on his occasional visits. His passing nolonger disturbed the staff. They now viewed him as an ally in theirproject. All the downstairs adults were well aware of when the girlturned seven. When she passed from eight to nine she could feel thechange too.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>When they day came for her official visit she was fussed over andprimped. She wore a beautiful dress that had been made collaborativelyby her mother and the Queen’s own seamstress from scraps of clothingthat were the residue of <b>upstairs’</b> projects. The girl was even taughtto stitch the hem herself.</p><p>The young girl stood now waiting in the hushed downstairs for Mr.Goldthread to escort her. Quiet and expressionless Mr.Goldthread arrivedand then guided her to a distant room in the royal family’s privatewing. Now there was no butcher paper with which she could distractherself. There was no cozy pantry break-room into which she could takerefuge. On this occasion she did not have her hallway of silent friendsand guardians, the downstairs staff, watching and rooting for her. Nowthe young girl was alone. She stood still and rigid in her pretty butitchy new dress. And she waited, all alone, in a very large, verybright, very quiet room.</p><p>Soon there paraded in bouncing and chattering children. They took placesin front of chairs and chaises. They stared at the little girl, or so itfelt to her. The young girl assumed their vigorous whispers were abouther, for she saw that her new dress was pale indeed in comparison to thefinery of the Queen’s own family. Then there was quiet. The Queenentered. She came and stood before the young girl who, well rehearsed,went down on one knee and bowed her head. The young girl heard thecommand to rise and looked up. Though she had spied the Queen many timesbefore (on her rounds to help the staff and when exploring back hallwayswith under butlers) the face that met her gaze seemed more severe. Thelittle girl felt the intensity of the Queen’s inspection.</p><p>“Hello young lady.” There was only friendliness in the Queen’s greeting,but the young girl responded only with silence and a bow of her head.She offered a competent, if miniature, curtsy. The Queen frowned. TheQueen had feared this change. The downstairs staff, with all their wellintentioned preparations, had stifled the girl. Now she feared theQueen, as did they all. The Queen was angry at how, she thought, theyhad turned the free and intelligent child she had so looked forward tomeeting into another respectful living doll.</p><p>“Why don’t you speak to me?” the Queen asked with her annoyance evidentin her voice. The girl’s face screwed up in discomfort. One hand wrungthe other. She crossed her legs at the ankle binding herself intosilence. Finally there exploded a huge exhalation. The girl blurted,“I’m not allowed to talk to you until you give me a mission. He saidit!” Pointing at Mr. Goldthread she clamped herself into silence again.</p><p>The Queen turned in confusion to her secretary. Mr. Goldthread said,“What I told her your Majesty was that she should wait to speak untilshe had been given <b>permission</b>. I believe she took me a bit tooliterally, and we may have lost a rather important syllable.”</p><p>With a nod, the Queen turned again to the young girl, “Here is yourmission: speak to me as we did those years before. Do you remember thatat all?”</p><p>“Oh yes Majesty. You stole my picture.”</p><p>“Yes I did,” said the Queen. The Queen’s children laughed for a moment,and then they too grew silent when the Queen focused on them in turn herinspecting gaze. “I apologize for that. I should have asked. Would youlike to do something today to make up for it?”</p><p>“We could play?”</p><p>“What would we play?”</p><p>“Tea!” shouted the young girl with excitement.</p><p>“Yes. Let’s all play tea,” answered the Queen. The Queen’s movement wasechoed by all in the room. All moved together towards the tea things.Unexpectedly the little girl’s lip again began to quiver. Her expressionbecame fearful.</p><p>Now, with an attitude more motherly than regal, the Queen knelt downbefore the little girl and put her hands on both the girl’s arms. TheQueen looked the young girl directly in the face and asked in a softvoice, “What is wrong?”</p><p>“I only know how to play with two people,” the girl whispered back.“That’s all he ever showed me,” And she again pointed at Mr. Goldthread.</p><p>“Well,” said the Queen rising again. “Mr. Goldthread has been remiss inyour education,” but she smiled as she said it. “We will rectify thatforthwith. Let us all go to play tea.” And with the small girl’s littlehand inside her own, they walked together to the table.</p></root><p><a href="chapter2.html">Next Chapter A Ghost Story</a></p></body></html>
