The<br/>preceding Monday preparations began. Mr. Goldthread would predictably<br/>appear and with his unique combination of amusement and severity<br/>instruct the little girl as to acceptable and unacceptable topics of<br/>conversation. These varied depending both on affairs of state and<br/>household gossip. Thus, the little girl was informed about politics at<br/>large and local - perhaps more informed than those instructing her<br/>perceived. This week ’Gina, for they now all, both upstairs and<br/>downstairs, called her by this nickname: the diminutive for Regina;<br/>found Mr. Goldthread looking at her with an expression that when she<br/>looked at him with both eyes seemed a scold, but when she squinted at<br/>him with just one eye seemed a smile. Mr. Goldthread told ‘Gina that<br/>this week, under no circumstance, was she to 1) inquire after Lord<br/>Fauxami, 2) request information on the Maldives, or 3) speak of cats.</p><p>The first two of the three did not present any problems, but for<br/>opposite reasons. As to the Maldives she was completely ignorant, except<br/>that she knew it was a place. She had been provided with a very good<br/>atlas, and later she would locate the Maldives on it. As to Lord<br/>Fauxami, she was completely informed about occurrences. The staff<br/><b>telegraph</b> was quite efficient. Regina knew from sources that Lord<br/>Fauxami had left the household in the company of Beatrice from<br/>housekeeping. ‘Gina always thought Beatrice silly and funny. This was<br/>because Beatrice never seemed to be able to find a uniform that fit her<br/>properly. Even when she was provided with a new uniform, a uniform that<br/>fit perfectly, ’Gina noticed that within a day or two, due to Beatrice’s<br/>bad luck, the uniform would have shrunk or been otherwise altered to<br/>such an extent that Beatrice was always forced to pull and tug to keep<br/>the odd corners of herself covered. Unfortunately, the tug that hid one<br/>bit of skin always revealed another elsewhere, and so it was that<br/>Beatrice never managed to stay completely modest. Beatrice’s work was<br/>always accompanied by a swishing, twitching mannerism that led to near<br/>calamity whenever she was required to dust the upper shelving - a<br/>responsibility from which , to her credit, she never shirked. In fact it<br/>was a responsibility for which she often volunteered.</p><p>In contrast to Beatrice’s apparel misfortunes, his Lordship Fauxami, a<br/>handsome man, was always finely dressed. ‘Gina had seen him several<br/>times through the valet spy holes. When she made rounds with the head<br/>butler it was not uncommon to come upon a group of young maids clustered<br/>about one of these peepholes. And while the head butler shooed them back<br/>to work, ’Gina took the opportunity to see what it was they had all been<br/>watching. Often it was the handsome figure of his Lordship Fauxami.<br/>’Gina could also tell whether Beatrice was likewise in the room. If so,<br/>the finely dressed Lord would appear distressed. ’Gina felt sorry for<br/>him. Whenever Beatrice entered a room to clean his Lordship would begin<br/>to cross and uncross his legs rapidly while leafing quickly through the<br/>book or newspaper he was reading. It little surprised ‘Gina that someone<br/>as nice as his Lordship (he had patted her on the head once when she was<br/>coming back from tea) would be concerned with Beatrice’s poor fitting<br/>clothes. It also did not surprise ’Gina when she learned that the<br/>generous Fauxami had decided to take Beatrice under his wing and outfit<br/>her properly. As ‘Gina thought about this she lightly stroked the cloth<br/>and pleats of her own dress and felt in her imagination the light<br/>slickness of the satin which she would be allowed to wear on Wednesday<br/>for tea. She saw in her mind’s eye the red dress being removed from its<br/>special closet on the floor above the one where she slept with her<br/>mother.</p><p>But now ‘Gina bit her lower lip: cats! How could she not talk about<br/>cats? Cats was about the only topic she had in common with the royal<br/>family. ‘Gina had a cat, or rather there was a cat that came daily to<br/>see ‘Gina for the scraps she fed it from the pantry. Each day in the<br/>mid-afternoon the cat appeared near the pantry door hissing at anyone<br/>who was not ‘Gina. Perhaps this was because whenever the cat appeared<br/>there and ‘Gina was not around the cat’s greeting consisted of a swat<br/>with a broom and a loud shout of “Shoo! Scat!” The cat therefore had<br/>become choosy, and would sit high up on a rafter watching for ‘Gina’s<br/>approach. At which approach the cat would jump down and walk zig zag<br/>between ‘Gina’s legs guiding her to the pantry where ‘Gina always<br/>managed to use her favored status to procure some small scrap for the<br/>cat.</p><p>‘Gina called the cat “Queenie” because tufts of fur around the cat’s<br/>ears looked to ‘Gina like a little crown. When ‘Gina had once mentioned<br/>her adopted pet to Her Highness, the Queen, at tea, the Queen’s children<br/>were all quite amused and teased Her Majesty. The Queen did not seem to<br/>mind though, because the Queen believed both in the truthfulness and the<br/>innocence of young ‘Gina’s account.</p><p>‘Gina liked having a topic to share at tea. Each tea time visit she<br/>would present a new account of Queenie’s conduct. It was ’Gina’s one<br/>sure conversational gambit. ’Gina always felt comfortable that a new<br/>Queenie story would please and amuse. This week ‘Gina had been planning<br/>to tell the story of the mouse Queenie had caught and left in the<br/>library. It had so startled Beatrice, who was dusting shelving at the<br/>time, that Beatrice had screamed with fright. This had caused Lord<br/>Fauxami, who was reading in the library, as he did frequently when it<br/>was time for Beatrice to dust, to leap to his feet and scatter newspaper<br/>everywhere. Beatrice, in her fright, completely forgot to tug and pull<br/>her uniform back into coverage, and his Lordship had to help her -<br/>although he did not seem to be particularly good at it as often more<br/>rather than less of Beatrice became uncovered. ‘Gina had thought she<br/>could just leave his Lordship out of the story, but now that she could<br/>not talk about cats what would she talk about?</p><p>Tea was at four o’clock. Precisely at 10 minutes until the hour Mr.<br/>Goldthread appeared to escort ‘Gina, in her red dress, up five flights<br/>of stairs, down two long hallways, across one large ballroom, up one<br/>more flight, down one more hallway, and then down a small spiral<br/>staircase to the family’s quarters and the small room where they shared<br/>tea. Mr. Goldthread having placed her there in front of her chair (with<br/>the large booster cushion) by two minutes to four would stand back.<br/>’Gina would wait in silence until one minute later the Queen’s children<br/>would appear, usually laughing, but occasionally snapping at each other.<br/>Always, though, they would be talking. Each would assemble in front of<br/>the various chaises and stools to which each had been assigned, and<br/>there they would lounge until at precisely four the Queen herself would<br/>appear. All the Queen’s children would briefly bow their heads, and<br/>‘Gina would kneel until feeling the toe of Mr. Goldthread nudge her<br/>heel. Then she would stand up and Mr. Goldthread would pick her up and<br/>plop her on the top of the towering pillow that filled her chair.</p><p>On this Wednesday ‘Gina felt a tension - though she would not have known<br/>to call it that. Everyone was quiet when the tea was poured (three parts<br/>milk, one part tea, and two teaspoons of sugar for ‘Gina) except for a<br/>daughter of the Queen, just a little bit older than ‘Gina, who sighed<br/>and sniffled, and once moaned. Seeing ‘Gina’s concerned look, the second<br/>oldest of the Queen’s sons turned to ’Gina and said, “Don’t worry about<br/>old runny nose.” He shot a dismissive sneer at his little sister. “She<br/>thinks she has seen a ghost.”</p><p>The young girl, who had overheard, shouted defensively back, “I have not<br/>seen a ghost. I have heard one!”</p><p>“OOOoooooo.” Two of the Queen’s other sons, twins, moaned together, and<br/>then quit in laughter.</p><p>“That’s not what it sounds like at all, and you know it. It’s just a<br/>meowing!” and here, her eyes puffy and red, the girl let out a long sob<br/>while the twins moaned “Meooooooooooow” and laughed.</p><p>The oldest of the Queen’s sons was almost a man. He leaned in towards<br/>‘Gina and said in an aside “Mietzie lost her cat, Chevalier, and she<br/>thinks he’s dead and haunting her. Really. Such caterwauling.” And a<br/>moment later reflecting on what he had said added, “Oh that’s rather<br/>good: caterwauling. I have to get that in to the conversation. Ask me<br/>‘Gina what all the racket is about so I can use my pun.”</p><p>But ‘Gina was too shocked by the topic of conversation to comply. “We’re<br/>not supposed to talk about …” she paused, “them.”</p><p>“What them?” the Prince asked.</p><p>“Them. Unh, furry purry things.” ‘Gina evasively answered.</p><p>The Prince frowned, thinking, and then, solving the puzzle, said rather<br/>loudly: “Cats! Oh good one. Why aren’t we supposed to talk of cats?”</p><p>The damage had been done. At the word ’cat’ Mietzie began to howl in<br/>deep sobs. “Chevalier! Chevalier! Who killed you?” And in answer there<br/>came a very faint, very high pitched, “Meow” The adults were distracted<br/>by all the clamor, and they had not heard the faint meow. The Queen’s<br/>boys and girls were too busy laughing at their sister, and also did not<br/>hear it, but Mietzie had and she let out a new sobbing cry. ‘Gina, who<br/>had heard it too, was puzzled. ’Gina momentarily forgot herself. Her<br/>mouth fell open and she said clearly “A cat?”</p><p>The Queen, so severe with herself and her staff, rarely disciplined her<br/>children. Now, as was typical, she calmly sipped tea while observing<br/>this domestic spontaneity. The Queen looked at ’Gina in curiosity when<br/>‘Gina said “A cat.” The Queen’s look was simultaneous with a bump from<br/>Mr. Goldthread’s knee on the back of ‘Gina’s chair. This bump caused<br/>’Gina’s tea to slop into its saucer. When Gina looked up from balancing<br/>this tea sea far from her pretty red dress she saw the angry glare of<br/>Mietzie focused on her.</p><p>“You’re making fun of me!” Mietzie accused. In fact, ‘Gina was the only<br/>one in the room who was not mocking Mietzie. ’Gina opened and closed her<br/>mouth in surprise. How can one defend oneself against a claim of mocking<br/>someone’s dead cat ’Gina thought, when you cannot talk about cats, and<br/>you don’t think the cat is dead?</p><p>“Why does she have to be here Mother?” Mietzie asked the Queen. “She’s<br/>common, and now she is mocking me. She doesn’t care about me or<br/>Chevalier. Poor thing. Gone three days, and still haunting me.<br/>Chevalier!”</p><p>In response to Mietzie’s speech the boys laughed, and Mietzie’s sisters<br/>tittered behind their hands. The Queen looked at her daughter and<br/>frowned. Mr. Goldthread’s expression and gaze did not waver from<br/>straight ahead. The servants who poured the tea retired at the angry<br/>words as if they were a signal to dismiss. Amid this tumult ‘Gina again<br/>heard a faint, plaintive “meow.” Again, lost in concentration she said<br/>in her soft questioning voice, “A cat.” This made Mietzie wail louder,<br/>and Mr. Goldthread again bumped ‘Gina’s chair, harder. This time the<br/>bump was hard enough that the saucer could not contained the tea and a<br/>few drops slopped from the saucer onto ’Gina’s only pretty dress. ’Gina<br/>saw two small drops darken her treasured red satin. Then the drops had<br/>company as ’Gina’s tears followed to make their own dark impressions on<br/>the red satin.</p><p>Her family’s tea disturbed, the Queen looked about at her tittering,<br/>laughing children. The Queen frowned in puzzlement at the tearful ‘Gina.<br/>Then the Queen turned to the sobbing Mietzie, and allowed herself a very<br/>human sigh. “Oh Mietzie. What’s gotten into you?”</p><p>Mietzie, in grief and afraid, haunted by her dead cat, leaped up.<br/>Mietzie’s face red, she hastily turned to speak to the the Queen, her<br/>mother. Perhaps habit, or perhaps the immediate silence that her quick<br/>gesture had produced in her kin, made Mietzie pause. Then Mietzie<br/>reconsidered and turned slowly around to point at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Her. She’s what wrong. This common servant’s child is what is wrong<br/>with me. This little unappreciative snipe comes here to our table and<br/>mocks me, a princess!” The more Mietzie spoke the more relieved she<br/>felt. Thinking little of what she said, but only how good the catharsis<br/>felt, Mietzie let herself continue without reflection or consideration.<br/>“My poor cat has been dead three days, and she doesn’t care,” pointing<br/>at Gina. “She’s probably the one that killed it. That’s why Chevalier<br/>haunts me. He wants to reveal the criminal. Her!” Mietzie pointed a<br/>trembling finger at ‘Gina.</p><p>‘Gina shivered. More tea drops and tear drops stained her red dress. The<br/>Queen was distracted and dismayed by this outburst. The Queen had not<br/>realized the level of her daughter’s distress. The Queen had been<br/>preoccupied with matters of the state and of the household (that cousin<br/>of her’s, Fauxami). The Queen was about to speak and reassure Mietzie<br/>when she saw from the corner of her eye the slight motion of ‘Gina’s<br/>shivering. The Queen turned to look, and at the Queen’s movement<br/>everyone else followed her gaze. All the children, including Mietzie,<br/>fell silent watching their Royal Mother watch the little girl. Little<br/>‘Gina quaked. Assuming fear the Queen readied herself to speak and<br/>reassure, but then the Queen paused. Something was not as it appeared,<br/>and the Queen decided, trained by years in charge, to wait until events<br/>became clearer.</p><p>Slowly ‘Gina’s shivering stopped. ’Gina raised her gaze from her spotted<br/>gown and stared directly into the eye’s of the accusing, grieving, and<br/>haunted Mietzie. ‘Gina looked very angry. All the children glanced at<br/>the Queen for reassurance when they saw ’Gina’s intense, cold stare.<br/>‘Gina’s chair rocked onto two legs from the force of Mr. Goldthread’s<br/>thump. His gaze never wavered, but he saw without looking as talented<br/>men of his station were able to do. More tea slopped, and ‘Gina was<br/>impelled by the forward tilt of her chair to stand. Slowly ’Gina turned<br/>and handed her cup with its flooded saucer to Mr. Goldthread who<br/>received it without comment and without looking down.</p><p>Then ‘Gina turned slowly back to the party. The Queen’s expression was<br/>curious, and the expression of the eldest Prince held an impish smile,<br/>but for all others there was nothing but fear or, in Mietzie’s case,<br/>contempt.</p><p>‘Gina’s instructions for royal conversation had been few. Speak only<br/>when spoken to. Never dispute. Always defer. But she now disregarded<br/>this advice. She went to both knees and asked the Queen’s permission to<br/>speak freely to her Royal Highness the Princess Mary Miriam Marie,<br/>usually called Mietzie.</p><p>The Queen’s life was a difficult one, but it was also an ordered one.<br/>The Queen was rarely surprised. She was often bemused, but infrequently<br/>amused. The Queen’s life was predictable. There were always problems,<br/>and uncertainties, but there were likewise protocols. While the Queen<br/>did not always know what the results of her actions would be, she almost<br/>always knew what course her actions should follow. Mr.Goldthread, as her<br/>advisor, was the only voice that she allowed to dissent, but as his<br/>training had conformed to her’s even he rarely surprised with unexpected<br/>advice. In the last several years, the only true surprise the Queen had<br/>had had come from this little offended, insulted girl kneeling before<br/>her. The Queen was wary. She did not want to lose her time with this<br/>little, dear, novelty, but she could not permit a commoner to insult her<br/>Princess daughter. What should ’Gina do? What would little ‘Gina say if<br/>allowed to speak? If ‘Gina should say something, anything, inappropriate<br/>to the Princess Mietzie the Queen should have no choice but to banish<br/>‘Gina from the upstairs. Cease contact. No more teas. No more childhood<br/>perspectives on her royal world. No more amusement. The Queen could see<br/>the animated activity on ‘Gina’s brow. ’Gina’s forehead creased in<br/>thought. ’Gina’s eyebrows knotted. Then the Queen saw ’Gina’s face<br/>relax, and the Queen, with hesitancy, regret, and a paradoxical<br/>enjoyment at her own complete ignorance of what would happen next<br/>assented. “Speak to the Princess Mietzie freely and … aware of her<br/>status, and yours.” the Queen added.</p><p>‘Gina seemed to have grown older while on her knees. She rose, and with<br/>head bowed, addressed the Queen politely. “Thank you your Highness. My<br/>station is clear.” Then, turning towards Mietzie, ’Gina raised her face<br/>and looking straight at the confused Princess (Why had Mother allowed<br/>this thing to speak to her freely? Mietzie thought. Mother was smart?<br/>Why would she do this?). Mietzie felt insecure, but the unease could not<br/>quench the sadness which had been transmuted to hurt and anger and that<br/>Mietzie had targeted for lack of any other option at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Princess. Did you breakfast in your chambers on the morning you lost<br/>your cat?” ‘Gina asked.</p><p>“I didn’t lose him. He died. You killed him. Or one of your people did.”<br/>And then glancing at the Queen and the Queen’s neutral expression<br/>Mietzie added, “No. I did not breakfast in my room.”</p><p>“Princess. Did you make your bed before leaving for breakfast?”</p><p>And here the rest of the Queen’s children could not suppress themselves.<br/>They all laughed. Even Mietzie had to smile. “No, ‘Gina. I did not make<br/>my bed.”</p><p>“Princess. When you returned from breakfast was your bed made?”</p><p>“Of course. There would have been consequences if it had not been. Maybe<br/>for your mother even.” And Mietzie’s smiled curled into a snarl.</p><p>“Princess. Did you see the servant that made your bed?”</p><p>“No. And I should not have. If you knew your place as well as the other<br/>servants I shouldn’t see you either.” Mietzie felt bad as she said this.<br/>Mietzie actually liked ‘Gina. ’Gina was almost her age, and ‘Gina seemed<br/>to like her cat stories about Chevalier. Mietzie did not like what she<br/>was saying to ‘Gina now, but for some reason she felt that royal rules<br/>of conduct demanded she finish what she started. Mietzie did not believe<br/>she should show any common person deference.</p><p>At this exchange ‘Gina walked directly towards Mietzie. Mietzie took a<br/>self-conscious step back, but ‘Gina passed beside her to go and stand at<br/>the bookshelf lined wall behind where Mietzie stood.</p><p>“It is fortunate for your Chevalier that I am a servant’s child, and<br/>that I know the place and ways of servants at least as well as you know<br/>Royal ones.” Taking the stool from beside a nearby chair, ‘Gina placed<br/>it near the book case. She stood upon it, turned and reached behind some<br/>books to grab a small handle that when she turned it clicked and<br/>revealed a small door that had been disguised by the book case. On<br/>revealing the door a louder “Meow” could be heard. As ’Gina opened the<br/>door to the hidden servants’ passage there ran out a fat Siamese cat. It<br/>raced to Mietzie who had fallen to her knees shouting “Chevalier.”</p><p>Mietzie’s brothers and sisters all raced to Mietzie and the cat. ‘Gina<br/>continued speaking: “You heard your cat trapped in the servant’s passage<br/>used to access your room when you are away. If you had known more of the<br/>servant’s ways, you could have saved your cat days ago, and without that<br/>knowledge it is you who would have killed your cat.” Then the royal<br/>family heard a click and a clack, and looked up from Mietzie’s reunion<br/>to find the room as it had been before except that ‘Gina was gone. ’Gina<br/>had left through the servants’ passage and closed the door behind her.<br/>The Queen’s offended gaze thought it detected a slight smile on the lips<br/>of Mr. Goldthread, but the Queen could not be sure. “Mr. Goldthread,”<br/>she scolded, “No one leaves the Queen’s company without being formally<br/>dismissed.’’ Then, looking down the Queen was met by the puzzled joy on<br/>Mietzie’s face. The Queen felt it echoed her own surprise. The Queen<br/>broke into a smile at Mietzie’s delight while she hugged her cat.<br/>Mietzie buried her face in Chevalier’s fur. The Queen added to her<br/>speech to Mr. Goldthread. “And make sure ’Gina knows that for next<br/>month.”</p></root><a href="chapter1">Prior Chapter Her Highness</a><p><a href="chapter3">Next Chapter Apologia</a></p></body></html>
