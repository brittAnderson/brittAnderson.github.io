To convince others shewas not a royal impostor she first had to convince herself. Today wasdifferent. She was, for the first time, looking forward to something. Anouting. A journey away from the traps and trappings of the school andthe evil eye of the severe Head Mistress. ’Gina would be with a friend,her one true school friend. The fair, loyal, intelligent, anddeprecating Helene.</p><p>She tried another gown. No, too much frippery. She chose somethingsimpler. One of the original dresses that Mietzie had given her. Mr.Goldthread had felt it was too simple for the niece of the pretender tothe throne, but he relented eventually. It was silk, and blue, and shecould move in it, and it still had some faint odor of home about it.</p><p>One last twirl before the looking glass was followed by a light seriesof raps at her door that ’Gina immediately recognized as the timid tapsof Helene.</p><p>“Come in Helene.”</p><p>The door slowly opened and Helene’s cute face appeared glancing aroundthe edge. “Oh. You look so beautiful Janus.” Everything Helene saidsounded sincere, and this compliment made ’Gina blush. The daughter of aservant girl had trouble seeing herself as anything but a servant girl.</p><p>“Oh. Helene. You flatterer.” But ’Gina followed this scold by going overto take her friend’s arm in hers, and together they began to leave theroom. “Are we walking?” ’Gina teased.</p><p>“No! Daddy sent his coach.” Helene shifted her voice into a lowerregister to imitate her father, “We will not have a descendant of theKaiserkönig line striding over here like the postman.” The two girlslaughed, and Helene continued, “You will like Daddy though. He is verycharming, and our cook has been in agony over what she will make you.”</p><p>Coming out into the afternoon sun ’Gina saw before the school’s frontdoor a small knot of children and some teachers and staff. A coach moregrand than the one she had come in stood before them. It was led bythree pairs of stallions. Two footmen were before the door. One with thestepping stool placed and steadied. The other held the door. The driverfaced forward, and Helene paused for a moment whispering to ’Gina. “Thisis the ambassadorial carriage. I have never been in it by myselfbefore.” And Helene turned to look with surprise at her friend who shenow realized must be much more than the “rich girl” she had assumed.</p><p>’Gina did not respond. She appeared distracted by the carriage, but inreality she was doing all she could to keep from running and shouting,for she spied across the street a dirty little figure huddled in acorner. His hair was a tangle and his face was black. He was gnawing theheel of a loaf of hard black bread. But through the grime she recognizedWillie. Willie was here. The moment he saw her looking at him he startedand retreated further into the alley behind him until his shadowshielded him. He is worried ’Gina thought. He is not here to see me, orgreet me, he is here to watch me. Her expression became grave, whichsuited the expectations of the Ambassador’s servants who escorted Heleneand her guest, Janus, niece of the pretender from Kaiserkönig into thecoach.</p><p>While Helene’s father did dote on her, the suggestion to invite Janus todinner had apparently not been motivated by paternal affection only. Thecoach took the most circuitous route imaginable to the ambassador’sresidence. Every street and resident in the city was to see the favorbestowed on the Ambassador, and by extension his country of Andalonia,by the House of Kaiserkönig. As if it were a diplomatic visit, he hadthe royal crest of Kaiserkönig hung upon the carriage abutting that ofthe royal house of Andalonia. All the other embassies and consulateswere sure to note the slow parade of the carriage with its pair ofheralds hanging on the doors. The long and circuitous ride did notbother the two girls. They bounced on the red royal plush inside, andtook turns gazing out of one side and then the other. Helene indicatedpoints of interest, and ’Gina had trouble maintaining the ruse that shewas a jaded royal. ’Gina delighted in her guided tour of the royal city.She was after all still a servant’s child by rearing and experience.Raised in a royal home ’Gina was familiar with the warren ways ofservant staff, and had glimpsed some of the regal marvels as she sweptor dusted or followed the butlers explanations of protocols anddynasties, but she had never seen a city, really. Let alone a royalcity. It would never have occurred to imagination to have guessed shewould one day view it from an Ambassador’s carriage.</p><p>At last their time on display ended. The driver pulled up before theEmbassy where excited and impulsive Helene swung open the carriage doorand leaped down eager to guide her friend inside. Footmen scurried toplace step stools, but were too late as Janus became ’Gina for a momentand followed her friend with a long leap from the carriage to thesidewalk. Again the two girls looped arms. Obviously watched from thehouse, and afraid of further breaches of decorum and protocol, the largeembassy doors swung open and the Ambassador, his wife, and Diego stoodon the steps in greeting. Seeing their formality ’Gina was disappointed,and it showed in a frown. This expression helped cement her return tocharacter, and it was effective in making the Ambassador purse his lipsin reflection. Helene hurried her friend up the steps and made, inmonotone and from memory, the formal words of introduction her fatherhad said were required. ’Gina, happy to be at a home again, and ready torelax from her constant vigilance of the school smiled at them all, evenDiego, and responded with warm, sincere words of appreciation and thanksfor the invitation. ’Gina gave a brief spontaneous hug to theambassador’s wife who returned it while the Ambassador tutted aboutprotocol. Still he reached out to tousle his daughter’s hair as heescorted their esteemed guest inside.</p><p>Dinner took place in the Ambassador’s formal dining room. ’Gina hadhoped for something less rigid. She had viewed the outing with theexpectations of seeing her girlfriend’s home; however, Helene’s fatherhad viewed it as a chance for social climbing and national lobbying. Itwas an unusual hybrid. Numerous courses of tiny samples were served. Adevastating amount of silver gleamed at each place (and ’Gina knew whateach piece was and what each piece was for as she had been schooled byhours spent in polishing and table setting all under the supervision ofthe second butler). One by one each piece was used to spear an asparagustipped with Hollondaise, or a few bites of flaky, buttery sole meunier,and on and on. Interspersed among the servings, manipulated and managedby a servant who stood silently behind each chair, was girl talk, schooltalk, and family gossip.</p><p>Helene was just concluding the story of the bee and ’Gina grew red witha combination of revived indignation and embarrassment. “You are a bitmore revolutionary than one would expect?” commented the Ambassador.</p><p>“Noblesse oblige” responded ’Gina.</p><p>“Well said,” replied the Ambassador. “Vous parlez Français?”</p><p>“Bien sûr Ambassador, mais je prefere Anglais”</p><p>“Ganz genau. English it is.”</p><p>“Dankeschön. Das ist sehr nett von Ihnen.” replied ’Gina.</p><p>At this the Ambassador had a belly laugh, though the rest of the companylooked confused. “Never mind. Never mind.” he said on seeing thefamily’s puzzled looks. “This one is very clever.” And he smiled againat ’Gina and wagged an admiring finger, but now the smile was only onhis lips and not in his eyes.</p><p>Dinner conversation proceeded along more neutral terms, but ’Gina hadbeen put back on her guard by this testing of the Ambassador and theslightly feral nature of his smile. Diego spoke little. Usually simplyto echo an observation of his father’s and to comment on its justness.’Gina could see now how Diego resembled his father. Smaller, fatter, butwith the same look of cunning sometimes peaking out behind his facade.Helene’s mother, in response to prodding by the father, asked ’Ginaquestions about the Kaiserkönig realm. She had spent some weeks there asa child. ’Gina did the best she could with her memory of the guidebookfacts she had been schooled in by Monsieur Franz. It seemed to satisfythe mother, whose own memory did not seem too secure on the matter, andmay in fact have been asking questions based on the same books. But ifHelene’s mother suspected anything she did not convey it. Helene’smother seemed much more in the mold of Helene, and she added a story ofher own school girl days when she had once been punished for sneakingout to see a boy from the town. The Ambassador had tried to interruptthe story, but Helene’s mother persisted, perhaps egged on by theshocked looks on Diego’s face and the giggles coming from Helene and’Gina.</p><p>Following on this was more innocent conversation, as if it was anothercourse, and indeed it synchronized with the delivery of the Tiramisuwith its caramelized topping flamed into place at each diner’s place.“So tell me,” the Ambassador began in a voice slyly different and moreprobing than before, “how does your Aunt view the current situation inthe capitol. We in Andalonia have complicated feelings on the currentalliances.”</p><p>This was clearly an invitation to entrapment or exposure. The Ambassadorwas probing to see if ’Gina, that is Janus, had been sent to the capitolto look for alliances on behalf of her ambitious and bitter Aunt, or itcould have been an invitation to confess treason so that he could curryfavor with the Queen’s house by exposing ’Gina. Mostly, on hearing thisquestion, ’Gina felt indignant on behalf of the Queen. Again, ’Ginaunderstood to a greater degree the deceit and scheming that every daysurrounded her Majesty. In her indignation ’Gina mustered one of the fewanswers that could have sailed her through these twin threats. “My Auntviews the situation in the Capitol as one not fitting for idlediscussion at dinner parties with people one has just met.” ’Ginapunctuated her response by a snake-eyed stare at the Ambassador. Hereturned her stare unsmiling, but after several seconds a decisionseemed to have been made. With a jolly, “Ah, wise advice from a wisewoman. What else should one expect?” The more convivial mood wasreestablished.</p><p>With this, the Ambassador’s wife chimed in with “ Please, Benedict. Nomore politics. Let the girls be school girls.”</p><p>“Of course, my Dear. That is as it should be.” The Ambassador smiled atHelene and his wife, and glanced without a smile at ’Gina. Then seemingto gather his humor he gave a shrug and cracked the coating of hisdesert with a spoon. As he did this a man entered from a side door andcame directly to the Ambassadors chair, bowed down with a single bend atthe waist, and placed his lips beside the Ambassador’s ear. The servantspoke so that no one else could hear, see his lips move, or deduce theimportance of the topic from his expression. Ah, ’Gina thought, he hashis own Mr. Goldthread. Something important has happened.</p><p>His message delivered, the man stood, and without acknowledgment of theongoing dinner or the people eating it, glided out of the room withbarely a hush from his soft steps on the carpet.</p><p>“I am afraid that a matter of some urgency has arisen.” And here heagain paused for several seconds to stare at ’Gina. “Dinner must beconcluded.”</p><p>“But Papa!” Helene spoke loudly, impulsively. “We haven’t finisheddessert. Janus hasn’t seen my room. You said she could stay and visitawhile, and you said…”</p><p>The Ambassador stood up abruptly, his chair tumbled back to the floor.No one moved, not even the footman whose job it was to pull back theseat when the Ambassador rose. He yelled at Helene, all the whilelooking at ’Gina. “You will go to your room immediately.” And with thegesture he used to emphasize his command he sent his dessert spoonflying. It struck one of the other immobile footmen behind thechildren’s side of the table. “Diego!” he shouted. Diego leaped to hisfeet, sending his chair flying backwards, but the footman behind Diego,alerted by the spoon to the chest (a spoon which still hung to his frontby its sticky caramel end) caught the chair before it hit the floor anddeftly pulled it back. “My Father.” Diego replied while standing toattention.</p><p>“You will escort Miss Kaiserkönig back to her school. Now.”</p><p>“The route Father?” By this question, Diego revealed himself to be otherthan the dullard he so convincingly played at school.</p><p>Pausing for a moment to think, the Ambassador said sarcastically, andafter a sideways glance at ’Gina, “I guess you had better go back theway you came. That is after all the way. Isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes Father.” came Diego’s obedient response.</p><p>“Excuse me,” the Ambassador said, and without waiting for responsesstrode out of the room using the same door the quiet man had used.</p><p>When ’Gina next looked at the Ambassador’s wife she saw her mouth hungopen. “My heaven’s!” the woman said while rising. The footman behind herpulled back her chair a look of relief on his face. “I do apologize MissKaiserkönig.” The Ambassador’s wife glanced in the direction that asobbing Helene had run off. “This is not customary, but the duties of myhusband’s position can be pressing and unexpected, and …” TheAmbassador’s wife seemed to have run out of explanation, and ’Ginajumped into spare her embarrassment.</p><p>“I do understand very well Madam Ambassador the tensions provoked byprofessional obligations.”</p><p>“How well put, Miss Kaiserkönig. You are truly a most remarkable youngwoman. I do hope we have the privilege of meeting again. Perhaps undermore social and less formal circumstances. For now, I am afraid, I willhave to retire to see to my husband and daughter and ask you to pleaseallow Diego to take you back by our carriage to your lodgings atschool.”</p><p>Various servants rustled about. Wraps were found. A coat brought forDiego. Footstools presented. And a very short time later Diego sat with’Gina in the carriage as it retraced its wandering route alongAmbassadorial lane to the school. ’Gina opened her curtains to watch thecity go by, though with much less interest than before. She wasdistracted by her thoughts. As was Diego, though he did not keep quiet.He seemed to feel a bond had been developed by this experience. A bondbetween children with demanding and important guardians. “Wow.” he said.Then for emphasis, “Wooow!”</p><p>“Does that happen often at your house?” ’Gina asked without taking hereyes from the view through her carriage side window.</p><p>“No. Never. I mean Dad will lose it in private sometimes. I have heardhim throw stuff in his office, but he always comes out looking calm. Andhe has never lost it at an official dinner.”</p><p>“Official dinner? Helene invited me as a friend!”</p><p>“Yeah. I know, but you have to be used to this right? You’re aKaiserkönig. Can you really have friends?” Diego did not mean hiscomment to be mean. He thought what he said should be obvious. “I don’tmean Helene of course. She’s for real. I mean generally. You know thateveryone has to want something. My father is the Ambassador ofAndalonia. You had to know he was going to try and score points out of avisit from a Kasierkönig. Andalonia needs trade deals.”</p><p>And ’Gina’s eyes grew moist at this. She thought of her talks withAlbrecht, his fencing instructor. The spoiled Mietzie. The cautiousQueen. And herself, scholar and spy, learning nothing important on thisadventure, but how no one could be trusted, and how passing for“important” meant disdaining relationships for anything but monetary orinformation value. Then, from her window, ’Gina spied the Queen’scarriage. ’Gina blanched. She knew all those servants, and none of themknew she was here. What would happen if one of them saw her and spoke?She slunk back into her seat. Diego, catching sight of her face andmovements glanced out his window and misinterpreted the source of herfear.</p><p>“Oh. The Queen’s carriage. Don’t worry. No one will bother you. Ourcarriage carries the Andalonian seal. We are on good terms with theQueen. Her men will let us pass. They won’t want an incident.” Diegorevealed himself to be an astute Ambassador in training. The footmen ofthe Queen’s carriage, she was clearly inside the residence before whichit was parked, observed the official Ambassador’s carriage approach andlined themselves up in some form of official acknowledgment. Inresponse, the Andalonian carriage slowed to a walk as it passed, and theAndalonian foot men took off their hats. After which the Queen’scarriage men did the same. Diego, spoke over his shoulder to ’Gina.“They always do this. It’s hilarious. The order is really important. TheQueen’s men always take their caps off after we do.” He then reached outthe window to wave to one of the Queen’s carriage men. By the streetlights ’Gina could see the faces of the Queen’s carriage men as theypassed. All held themselves to attention with eyes averted, accept forthe one that Diego waved to. He was as erect as the others, but hesmiled when they drew opposite and gave a broad wink to Diego. Diegoturned around and said to ’Gina. “That’s Jimmie. He’s a friend of one ofour footmen and comes by the house a lot. He does magic.”</p><p>’Gina had been pressed deep into the carriage, as far from the Queen’smen as she could be, but when Diego turned to speak Jimmie followedDiego’s gaze with his own eyes to see to whom it was that Diego had beenspeaking. At this moment a gaslight from ’Gina side of the street shonethrough her the drawn curtain of her window to illuminate her face. Hergaze met Jimmie’s. She watched his smile disappear in surprise, and thenshe saw his face grow dark and a sneer curl his lip. The carriage, nowpast the Queen’s, resumed its trot and distanced itself from the Queen’sretinue. Diego and ’Gina heard some vague shouting and looked at eachother in confusion. Then there was a loud thunk from ’Gina side of thecarriage.</p><p>“What was that Diego?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” then to the coachman, “Coachman. What was that sound?”</p><p>“Can’t say Master Diego. Everything is fine up here. No road debris.Footmen?” he shouted. And two Oys echoed back an all okay from behind.While startling, it was not clearly threatening, and ’Gina waspreoccupied with what would be the effect of Jimmie’s seeing her. Shehad been sure he would recognize her, but when she saw that cold look ofhatred on his face, she began to doubt herself. Did he really take herfor a Kaiserkönig? Was that the reason he stared with such hatred. Evenas a Queen’s man, such an open display of contempt would have beenintolerable, even towards an enemy, let alone a young girl riding in anAmbassadorial carriage. She could not puzzle out the connection. AndDiego knew him. Did that mean something. He visited the Ambassador’sresidence to see a friend? Must have been often if Diego knew him wellenough to learn of his magic past.</p><p>Diego sensed ’Gina’s disquiet, but he did not understand it. He thought,with his perspective as the son of an Ambassador that it must havesomething to do with the bad state of relations between the Queen andher estranged distant cousin the Countess of Kaiserkönig. He made one ortwo efforts at conversation, but then let ’Gina be, and he simplywatched the nighttime streets pass by his carriage window.</p><p>Eventually, the Ambassador’s gauche, bragging parade route of a pathcame to an end in front of the school. Footmen opened doors. Footstoolswere placed. Diego descended first and offered his hand to ’Gina as hehad seen gentleman do for ladies. ’Gina took it as form and withoutwarmth, and still lost in her thoughts turned to watch Diego ascend, thefootstools to be removed, the footmen to climb up, and the coachman tocrack his whip and snap his reigns to move the horses on the wide u-turnthat would turn the carriage back upon its way. Diego waved to her fromhis window, and after the carriage had turned around he waved again fromwhat had been ’Gina’s side. ’Gina waved back, and as Diego passed ’Ginasaw glinting in the street light a few inches below the window’s sillthe sparkling silver sheen of the exposed portion of the blade of athrowing knife embedded in the carriage door.</p></root><a href="chapter13.html">Prior Chapter Going Postal</a><p><a href="chapter15.html">Next Chapter …—…</a></p></body></html>
