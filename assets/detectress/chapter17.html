The first time she began to slip off the horse. Hans barelymanaged to grab her. Then he switched positions so as to have hersitting in front of him. exhausted from her travels, and still with theeffects of knock out drops, ‘Gina was rocked by the galloping horse intoa semi-slumber. Always, when she awoke, there was the same thought: Whatis the plot? How do I protect Her Majesty?</p><p>The heightened security at the castle, and their rapidly approachingdust cloud, led to them being expected. Rather than the stables, Hansrode the galloping horse directly to the servants’ door at the castle’sback. ’Gina heard her mother’s shouts of “Baby Girl. Where is my babygirl?” long before she saw her. When ’Gina jumped from the horse to runto her Mother ’Gina saw, in addition to her Mother, Mr. Goldthread, theQueen, several soldiers, and a few Swiss Guards she had not met. WhileMother and daughter hugged Hans conferred with the Queen, Mr.Goldthread, and the Swiss Guard’s commandant.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread broke from the group to walk toward ’Gina. Seeing himover her mother’s shoulder she began shouting, while still hugging hermother: “A plot Mr. Goldthread! Jimmie has planned something against theQueen, that is why …”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread interrupted. “Quite right young lady. Herr Gafner hastold us as much, but what is the plot? What are we to defend against?”</p><p>’Gina broke from her mother’s hug, but still held her hand. She turnedto face Mr. Goldthread, and saw that all the others were staringsilently at her - including the Queen, whom, in the excitement of herreunion with her mother, she had forgotten was there. ’Gina dropped toher knee. “So sorry Your Majesty. In the excitement I forgot.”</p><p>“No time for that now ’Gina. No ceremony on the battlefield. What is theplot against which we must prepare?”</p><p>’Gina rose and stared back, paused, and then moaned loudly “I don’tknow!”</p><p>The Queen walked toward ’Gina and extended both her hands to ’Gina.“Dear,” ’Gina took the Queen’s two hands in her own and looked up atthis Woman, this Ruler, this Mother who was glancing now at the dirty,stained, caked strip of cloth that wrapped ’Gina’s little finger. “Youhave done so much for me. So much for your country. I came to you withsuspicions of espionage, and put you where I thought a stray word mightcome your way and help me deduce the source of leaks. I did not expectyou to be so successful in exposing and collapsing all, and to do sowhen you were under such risk, and when you were where you would sufferso much for your intelligence and your patriotism. suffered so much. Itis enough that we know that there is a plot. All that we owe to you. Donot fret, and do not doubt your accomplishment …”</p><p>Somewhere in the course of the Queen’s complimentary speech ’Gina’s mindhad begun to wander. Although he was standing in front of her, ’Ginafelt as if Mr. Goldthread’s knee had jostled her chair one more time,goading her on. Those watching saw ’Gina’s head tip back slightly andher gaze go up and far away, she began to mumble out loud, which theQueen, lost in her oratory, had not noticing ’Gina’s reverie, continued“… which has been ever so much more than …”</p><p>While ’Gina softly said, “… a plot … here at the castle. That’s whathe said. That’s why he wanted to distract the guards and soldiers intocoming after me. Here at the castle, but what is it? The castle is asafe hold, and so it must be different. Something must be different. Wemust find that difference.” Then louder, ignorant of the fact that theQueen was still talking and praising her she said loudly, “Mother!”</p><p>The Queen was not used to being interrupted, but she had come to know’Gina well and excused her creative bursts. ’Gina spun around, sayingagain, “Mother. Mr. Goldthread. We know that whatever is to happen is tohappen here. We know that because Jimmie went to so much trouble to drawthe Guards away. Despite that, we know it cannot be anything as simpleas a direct attack. His team was too small. There are no armies on theway. Herr Gafner and I would have seen something. And Jimmie was a spy,a subtle man. We know therefore that something is happening here, andthat it is a threat, and like everything Jimmie has done, a secret andhidden, and possibly just like him, in plain sight; if we only knew whatto look for. And Mother, who knows what the castle should look like bestof all?”</p><p>“We do. The staff do!”</p><p>On hearing this Mr. Goldthread began to move quickly towards the castle.The Queen, Hans, ’Gina, and her mother followed. They found thesurprisingly quick Mr. Goldthread already in the bell room janglingevery bell loudly and randomly. Servants came running from alldirections. “Bring me the head maid and head butler now!” He commandedthem, and the downstairs staff that had responded immediately ran awayagain.</p><p>Within moments the head of the domestic staff appeared and Mr.Goldthread gave them a quick and succinct charge. A threat had been madeagainst the Queen. It came from an unknown source, and was by an unknownmethod. But whatever source, and by whatever method, it would be via aroute and mechanism distinct from standard household practices. No oneknew their jobs, their procedures, their household better than theQueen’s personnel. They must command that each person with a diligenceunnaturally enhanced and elaborated inspect and evaluate every quarterof the castle that fell under their experience and responsibility andreport any anomaly - on this point Mr. Goldthread’s voice was boomingand he repeated - ANY ANOMALY. No matter how small or apparentlyinsignificant each must be reported to him. In response, and givingevidence of the staff’s professionalism and preparation, there were noquestions. The Heads of household turned and immediately begandispensing down their hierarchy orders and priorities, and establishingthe chain for reporting.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread turned at this point to ’Gina’s mother, but before hecould speak to her, she had already begun speaking to ’Gina. “My love.Oh how I worried and missed you, and I can’t believe it, but I have togo. My duty here is clear. I must do my part.” She kissed ’Gina quicklyon the cheek, and hearing her voice called with a military clarity sheresponded, “Here,” and walked out of the room with no hesitation. Mr.Goldthread redirected himself and speaking communally suggested that theQueen, ’Gina, and Hans would be in the way here, and that the businesswould be done more effectively if they removed themselves, and he guidedthe party away. As he did so the Queen put an arm around ’Gina’sshoulder and pulled her close to ask in a whisper, “Do you have news ofAlbrecht?”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>They sat in a small parlor near the Queen’s war room. It was down thehall from where, so recently but seemingly so long ago, ’Gina and theRoyal Family had taken tea together. The Queen pretended to read, andhad given ’Gina a book from Albrecht’s collection to distract her. TheQueen’s choice had been random, and she did so without looking at thetitle. It was Robert Louis Stevenson’s <b>Kidnapped</b>. Even if the choicehad not been so inapt, ’Gina would still have not been able to read. Shewas still distracted by trying to puzzle out the plot. ’Gina started atevery creak that might be the approach of news. She did not think shewas alone in her distraction. Only Hans remained still and apparentlyrelaxed in his vigilant posture by the door. Mr. Goldthread paced backand forth, back and forth, behind their chairs, while the Queen neverseemed to move her reading beyond its current page. She idly rotated thejeweled snake that encircled her wrist.</p><p>Periodically reports did come, but they were always negative. The staffhad sectioned the house into floors and regions of floors intoindividual responsibilities. The investigation had begun with thoserooms nearest to the Queen and her family. Staff who dusted looked fordust where there should be none, and looked for no dust where they knewthere might be some. Valets inspected clothes and their ordering. Wherethere stains; spots; blunt creases or pleats? Keys were tried in locks.Locks were tried without keys. Candles and lamps were lit, and smelled,and then extinguished. Nothing. Nothing was amiss. The reports cameregularly now, and were always delivered professionally, but there wassome implicit sense of disappointment as the staff’s searches moved awayfrom the upper floors to the lower reaches, then the question came,“Sir,” the head butler said addressing Mr. Goldthread, “did you mean toinclude the downstairs in your investigations.”</p><p>“I did indeed, and I expect that the investigations will be as thoroughand as diligent and as scrupulous to ANY ANOMALY as they have beenupstairs.”</p><p>“As you wish Sir.” And the black swallowtail coated Head Butler turnedsmoothly and elegantly and departed. Hans continued standing, Mr.Goldthread resumed pacing, and the Queen and ’Gina resumed reading andre-reading the same pages they had distractedly been reading all theafternoon.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and it opened to admit Mietzie who beganspeaking directly to the Queen. “Mother. I mean Your Majesty. Theyounger children are quite exasperating, I mean exasperated by beingkept in their rooms, and with not having had anything to eat sincebreakfast, could we now serve tea …” She broke off when she at lastrecognized ’Gina. “’Gina!”</p><p>Even as ’Gina felt her muscles tense to spring from her chair and run toMietzie she felt the communicative tap-tap of Mr. Goldthread on the backof her chair. ’Gina then turned with a great effort at self-controltowards the Queen, but before she could begin to ask her permission tobe excused the Queen simply gave a loud sniff in the direction of Mr.Goldthread, and said to ’Gina afterwards, “Please my dear.” Before thesentence was complete ’Gina jumped from her chair running to Mietzie.They met in the middle and knocked themselves to the floor with theforce of their greeting and hugs.</p><p>“Tell me! Tell me!”</p><p>“Tell you what?” Gina asked laughing.</p><p>“Everything! What is the city like? What was school like? Did you makefriends? Better friends? Did you meet any boys?</p><p>“Wait. What is going on? Why are you here? Do you know what is going onand why the house is locked and searched? ’Gina? Mother?”</p><p>’Gina had not answered any of Mietzie’s questions yet. The two girls satcross-legged on the floor and each had an arm slung over the shoulder ofthe other. They regarded the Queen from that position.</p><p>The Queen spoke, “’Gina knows the answer to many, maybe all thosequestions, but she has not been given leave to speak of them at thistime. Soon though Mietzie,” the Queen had seen Mietzie’s moue. “You makean excellent suggestion though. Let us go into tea. I am sure the otherchildren will be happy to see you too ’Gina, and the visiting may helpus try to paint a little happiness on the face of this gloomy day.”</p><p>As all rose to leave the Head Butler presented himself in the doorway.Mr. Goldthread spoke, “Yes?”</p><p>“We have completed all investigations and found only…, you did say anyanomaly Sir? Well then, we have completed our investigations and surveyand have discovered only one single anomaly. The Queen’s silver is shortone spoon from its inventory of two days ago.”</p><p>“One spoon?” Mr. Goldthread asked. “In the entire household the onlyirregularity perceived by any staff member was a single missing spoon?”</p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p>And while Mr. Goldthread grumbled the Head Butler stepped aside and theQueen led her family to tea.</p><p>On entering the room ’Gina felt a small portion of her wonder and smilereturn. This had been the scene of so many happy conversations. Truethere had also been trying times in the beginning, but from theperspective of recent events they did nothing to decrease hersatisfaction on returning. She gathered in hugs and kisses from theyounger children, and the twins begged to see her finger, but shedeclined, and they complained that nothing interesting ever happened inthis silly old castle and if it did no one ever let them see it.</p><p>The queen was enjoying her scene of domesticity. It was a slight treaton a day of great distress and uncertainty. In a spontaneous mood shedismissed the two maids who customarily served, and turned to askMietzie if she would like to pour? Mietzie was clearly pleased by thehonor. Her mother had never asked her to pour before, had neverentrusted her with the responsibility. ’Gina allowed herself to sinkback slightly in her chair (she did not allow her back to touch thechair’s back - she did not want another Mr. Goldthread tap), but she didrelax a bit and began to enjoy the sun coming in through the thickmullioned panes and to feel the breeze come in from outside with thescents of Spring and the faint twitters of song birds courting. Fromthis contented posture she saw Mietzie ask Hans if he would like a cup?Hans declined. Then, having had tea with Mr. Goldthread many timesbefore, Mietzie began to prepare his cup. ’Gina tensed when she sawMietzie pause. ’Gina had begun to have a thought, but as it had notreached its end yet she was not sure what it meant. She had to wait forit to finish.</p><p>“What is it Mietzie dear?” The Queen asked.</p><p>“Nothing really Mother. I just thought that there should be tongs forthe sugar. Mr. Goldthread takes two lumps. Oh well, I will just use this…”</p><p>“STOP!” ’Gina and Hans yelled together. “Stop and do not move!” ’Ginacontinued. Silently. Quickly. With Hans at her left shoulder, she movedtowards Mietzie.</p><p>’Gina gazed at the sugar dish Mietzie was holding. ’Gina thought, thereshould be sugar tongs here, but there are not. No staff would forget toput tongs out for tea, and even as ‘Gina thought this she observed theshiny tiny silver tea spoon of the Queen resting in its place. ’Ginatook the dish from Mietzie and handed it to Hans. She then picked up thespoon by its end and moved it back and forth in the light. “It is damp.”Hans said, and ’Gina nodded. Hans took the spoon from her. Their jointgaze settled on the sugar cubes.</p><p>Hans then took a saucer and the tea pot and poured a small amount of teaonto the saucer. He then used a different spoon to put three sugar cubesin the middle of the warm tea sitting in the saucer. Slowly the sugarbegan to dissolve into the warm weak tea. As the silent room watched theboys who complained of nothing interesting ever happening shelteredthemselves by the lee of their mother’s knees. Hans walked the saucerover to the open window and placed it on the sill. Flies soon buzzedabout they syrup, but before a single one could land, a small goldfinch,egg yolk yellow in its Spring plumage, landed on the saucer’s edge anddipped its beak in staccato fashion into the syrup. It stopped, trilledonce, and confusedly flew into the room for a few feet before droppingunmoving onto the carpet. Mr. Goldthread looked at Hans and said only“Operation Heimattort.” Hans walked to the door and barked something inhis dialect at the two guards outside. In the meantime the Queen hadstood, gathered her brood, and Hans ushered them out of the doorfollowed by Mr. Goldthread. Mietzie only had time for one glance backand a wave, and then ’Gina was left alone in the tea room. No one hadspoken to her. They had all just left.</p><p>’Gina returned to her chair, and allowed herself to slump against theback. She imagined she could leave. She thought she could leave.Obviously, with an assassination attempt on the royal family, somesafety plan had been triggered. She did not think it was likely theywould be coming back. But still, she had not been dismissed, and so’Gina decided to wait a bit. Slowly her body began to slump, and soslowly she did not realize what was happening there was a flutter ofimages, and then she fell asleep. Was that her Mother’s hand strokingher head? Was that a dream? ’Gina was so tired. So tired. But she hadsaved the Queen.</p></root><a href="chapter16.html">Prior Chapter Flight</a><p><a href="chapter18.html">Next Chapter Confoederatio Helvetica</a></p></body></html>
