Stunned and openmouthed, she hastily dropped into a bow. Wisps of white hair workedtheir way loose with this uncommonly quick maneuver. The cook’s rightshoulder made mini-spasms as she began to reach up to adjust her loosehairs, remembered she was before a royal, and stopped. Then she wouldfeel the tickle of her hair and began to reach again. Then she wouldremember the royal, and so on. Then she smelled the sausage beginning toburn, and again she remembered the royal.</p><p>Albrecht opened his mouth to speak, and a bell tinkled. He closed hismouth. Opened it again, and again there was a tinkling sound. Thoughthis time it was of a higher pitch. Nonplussed, Albrecht forgot himself,and spoke normally.</p><p>“Madam, your sausage is burning.”</p><p>Cook took this as permission to rise. With a practiced movement shewrapped her hand in her apron, slid the heavy cast iron skillet to oneside and then made a quick spastic jerk that set all the sausages on aroll. She arrested their roll with another quick movement and theiruncooked sides were now against the skillet. Albrecht admired her skill.Again, Albrecht made ready to speak. Again, he was interrupted bytinkling bells.</p><p>“Madam …” he paused - no bells. “Madam …” A low tinkle, and then ahigh tinkle. He decided to ignore them. “Madam. Her Highness the Queenhas decided that she would like her daughter Mietzie to learn certaindomestic skills and…”</p><p>Bells began to toll in alternation low and high, and now the twooriginal peals where joined in chorus by two more, one each of a lowerand higher note than before. If Albrecht had been able to ignore thebells before, it became impossible now. He had been practicing hisspeech for the last half an hour (the Queen had never before set him apersonal errand on her behalf) and he became befuddled by the clanging.“Blast it, Madam! Why are those bells ringing?”</p><p>“That would be yur bra’s and sistrs, Prince. The bell room is nest’or,and each of them tones is one of yur sib’s askin fer a tension. See feryursel Sir.”</p><p>Albrecht turned about and followed the tinkling to its source. There onthe wall hung the servants’ “glockenspiel.” Four bells near the centerwere jangling vigorously. Approaching, Albert saw that each was aslightly different size, and so each a slightly different pitch. Thefour bells that rang constantly were now joined in song by one more oneach side. Sandwiched between them, and conspicuous by its stillness,was a single bell. Above that bell was a name: Mietzie. Sounding morelike a twelve year old than a seventeen year old Albrecht screamedMietzie’s name, and began to run up the stairs taking them two at atime.</p><p>As Albrecht came to the nursey hall he saw his siblings standing intheir doors frowning and bickering. Some of the older children yelledfor his assistance, but he passed them by with a wave on his way toMietzie’s quarters. Angry, but too out of breath to give vent to it, hecame to her door and saw four chamber maids gathered in respectfulsilence as Mietzie lectured them on how to make a bed. Mietziecheerfully greeted her brother.</p><p>“Albrecht. Good morning.” Mietzie ran around the pile of bedding thatshe had heaped on the floor to reach the other side of her bed. Thereshe tugged slightly at the single sheet that lay on it, and then ranback to the original side. “I think I have a natural aptitude for thiswork. No wonder we need so many staff. Their procedures are soinefficient. Look at this sheet. It isn’t even long enough to cover frommy head to my toes. I have been trying to adjust it for the last fiveminutes. And none of these girls seems to have ever noticed this before.It’s a good thing I am going to train as a servant, because I will needto degrade my competencies to fit the position.”</p><p>“Mietzie. All the maids know why the sheet doesn’t fit, but being maidsthey don’t feel they can tell you. You have it sideways. Look.” And hegrabbed the sheet, spun it about, and with a billow spread it across thebed. “Furthermore, you have brought the floor to a standstill. Breakfastis burning. The staff is idle. And our brothers and sisters are playingQuasimodo with the downstairs message bells. Please do not help anymorefor a moment.” And with a gesture of his head he signalled the staff tobegan their work. Two immediately left to tend to the adjacent rooms,while the two remaining practiced hands quickly tidied up the bed underMietzie’s glowering eye.</p><p>After the staff had left, Mietzie spoke angrily to Albrecht. “If theyhad known I was doing it wrong, they should have told me instead ofstanding there like an audience at the opera.” Mietzie did not like theopera. “I had been practicing for an hour before they got here, and Idid it right every time. I just got confused when they were all watchingme.”</p><p>Albrecht smiled. He respected his sister’s enthusiasm. “Mietzie, ofcourse they didn’t tell you. We have trained the staff to be silent andrespectful. None of these women will feel comfortable correcting you.”</p><p>“What about Monsieur Franz?”</p><p>“Well, he is a tutor. His role as a servant is to question and to teach,but even he is narrow in his practice. He will chide your isoscelestriangle, but not your manners, or your opinion on the household. And hedoesn’t know how to be a personal servant himself, so he cannot teachyou how to be one.”</p><p>“But then how can I learn? ’Gina needs me.”</p><p>Albrecht had his doubts about that, but kept those to himself. Thesilence of the watching maids had been a lesson for him if not forMietzie.</p><p>“Yes. How will you learn to be a servant? We need someone to teach youto do what is to be done when you are told to do it. We need someone whohas not been taught to keep silent when a royal approaches. Someoneobediant, but unschooled in the ways of the household, someone … likeWillie. Sister, change your shoes to boots. I have the perfect teacherto instruct you in the ways of servitude.”</p><p>Half an hour later Albrecht led Mietzie across the large back lawntoward the riding stables. There he introduced her to Willie. Willie wasstanding in a horse stall with a shovel in his hands. He was small forhis age, which Mietzie would have guessed as about the same as her own.He beamed a smile, and his blond hair went in every direction. He wore adirty shirt with an old fashioned knotted collar under some sort ofmilitary jacket that was clearly much too big. His pants where nearlyinvisible because the hem of the jacket scrapped the top of the highboots he wore.</p><p>“Willie. This is Mietzie.” Albrecht purposely avoided referring to heras Princess Mietzie. “She needs to learn some basic skills for being aservant, and I have brought her here for your instruction.”</p><p>Willie’s smile broadened. “Sure thing Prince.” His voice was easy andmusical. He showed respect, but not deference with his attitude. “Andthere is no time like the present. Here you go Mitz’.” And he extendedhis arm to offer her the shovel, while he stepped back out of the stall.“Start by scooping these apples into that barrow.”</p><p>Mietzie turned to her brother, but before she could speak heinterjected. “You heard the boy Mitz’. Start shoveling apples. I’ll beback to check on your progress later. Thanks, Willie.”</p><p>Mietzie was stunned by the rapidity of this transition, and her brotherhad already turned and started to walk away when she managed to sputterout her question. “What kind of apples grow in stables?”</p><p>“Not the kind you would want to eat I’ll guarantee you. Now come on. Wedon’t have all day. Start shoveling.” And Willie scaled the stable’sside to sit himself on the highest rung.</p><p>Mietzie cautiously entered the stable holding the shovel out before heras a weapon.</p><p>“Their not the kind that bite either.” said Willie.</p><p>“There are no apples in here there is only horse …” she sought for asufficiently genteel, but still accurate, word. “droppings.”</p><p>“We call them apples.” Willie said with a laugh. “And they need to go inthat barrow. You must have spent all your life working inside not toknow that. I guess you must have really cheesed one of the indoorsbigwigs to get sent out here.”</p><p>And Mietzie looked up to see the her brother’s now small figure walkingback across the lawn toward the castle. “Yes. I guess I must have.” Andthen she bent over and gently slid her spade under one small dropping.</p><p>“They don’t move either.” Willie said. “Go faster.” And he laughed whenshe frowned at him. “You can give me snake eyes all you want sister, butwhen you get sent down to learn how to muck stalls I know I ain’t gotmuch to be a feared of.”</p><p>“I’m not mad at you. I am mad at …” and then Mietzie realized all atonce that Willie did not know she was a Princess “him.” And she used aflip of her head to gesture at Albrecht.</p><p>“Oh, he isn’t a bad one as royals go. Always treats me fair, and heknows his horses. Not like some of the others that treats ’em like theywere disposable. Prince Albrecht rides them with respect, and he sits afine horse. Now seriously, let’s go or we won’t get done. I’ll show youonce. You’re just using your arms. You’ll get too tired that way. Backand legs. Back and legs.” He jumped down, took the shovel, and made twosmooth swoops into the wheelbarrow. “Now you try.” And he jumped back upto his perch on the top rung of the stable’s wall.</p><p>Channeling her anger into her motions, Mietzie tried to imitate Willie’ssmooth motion, but instead of landing her scoop into the barrow sheaccidentally sprayed an arc around the stable. She streaked her dressand painted a line on the stable wall that crossed Willie’s boots.Gazing, horrified at herself and at Willie’s boots, she stammered out anapology.</p><p>Willie was laughing again. “I shoulda seen that coming. No worries.That’s why we wear boots and take a weekly bath. Now keep at it. I’ll goget another shovel and we’ll work on it together.”</p><p>They finished mucking the stall together, and then they each began onanother. Willie took charge of moving the horses from the dirty stallsto the clean ones while Mietzie continued to shovel. He also tried notto make her feel bad, but he still did four stables in the time it tookher to do one.</p><p>“Now we put in fresh hay, and this isn’t apple picking anymore. This’fork will put a hole through your foot the size of a finger, so becareful.” And after Willie handed her the pitchfork he watched hercarefully. He was attentive and mimed the motions necessary for Mietzieto safely stab a bunch of hay and discharge it into a cleaned stable.When Mietzie had done one stable, Willie brought her with him to placeher hand along side his as they led a large, beautiful horse back intoits clean stall. Willie spoke to the horse as they walked. Willie calmlymumbled little nothing phrases as he gently patted the side of thehorse’s neck with his freehand.</p><p>“This is Albrecht’s horse.” Willie told her after she had latched thestable gate. “And now we get a break. Did they give you anything forlunch before they kicked you out of the big house? No? Well, I guess wecan share mine today, but I’ll get the stable master to let ’em knowthat if they are going to keep sending you down here they got to feedyou.”</p><p>“Because the apples aren’t very nutritious are they.” Mietzie said witha tired smile as they sat on a stack of fresh hay by the main door intothe stables.</p><p>“Well I don’t know what tritious means, but no, I wouldn’t want to dineon them apples.” Willie laughed with her.</p><p>“It is very generous of you to share your lunch with me.” And Mietziemeant it, but she was having a little trouble figuring how to begineating the hunk of bread she held in one hand or the small share of coldbeef congealed in fat she held in the other.</p><p>“We staff have to stick together. That’s all. Fairs fair. We can’t justring a bell whenever we’re hungry can we?” Mietzie’s faced reddened whenhe said this.</p><p>“And even if we could,” Mietzie said, “maybe we shouldn’t.”</p><p>Willie took a big bite of his beef, and with his mouth full said to her,“What you waitin’ for Mitz? Knife and fork?” and Willie laughed again</p><p>While Willie munched away, Mietzie cautiously nibbled at the bit ofbread she held. She did not have her usual appetite, and returned thehunk of meat to Willie with thanks. As they ate, she asked him, “Why doyou do this Willie. Work so hard for cold meat and boots caked in …stable stuff.”</p><p>“<b>Stable stuff.</b> I like that. Well what else would I do, starve? Youwant to eat. You got to work. And I like horses, and the big housetreats me fair. Sometimes the horses need exercising when the house isaway, and sometimes they let me help with that. No one else I know hasever ridden a horse for anything but plowin. I get to ride for pleasure.And they treat me fair here. No one hits me as long as I do as they tellme. Do they hit you in the big house?”</p><p>“No. I have never been hit in the big house.” Mietzie replied, butwondered if there had been times that she may have deserved it. “It’seasy to forget about here, when you are in there.”</p><p>“Oh. Don’t fret. Albrecht is fair. I’ll bet they have you back at yourold job before you know it. Least ways cause you’re not very good atthis one.”</p><p>Mietzie laughed with him, and leaned her head back into the straw torest until they had to start again.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>When Willie saw Albrecht start across the lawn he went out to meet him,and spoke quietly. “Prince Albrecht. I don’t think you should keep thatgirl you brought out here in the stables. She ain’t suited to it.”</p><p>“Giving you too much trouble too, Willie?”</p><p>“No. She works hard. She just ain’t trained to it. She fell asleep atlunch, and when I went to wake her I saw her hands were all bloody. Ishouldn’t’a made her do so much shoveling I guess, but I ain’t neverknown anyone with hands that dainty. How could she do any washing orcleanin without her gettin a bit more sturdy? So, I was worried, and Ilet her sleep.”</p><p>Willie and Albrecht walked together to stand by Mietzie sleeping on thehay stack. “She does work hard Willie. She just has a very different jobthan you, and it isn’t one that has had her cleaning or washing ormucking. She’s actually my sister, Princess Mietzie.”</p><p>“Oh. Oh. Oh.” Willie jogged in a circle while repeating “Oh.” “I didn’tknow Albrecht. Honest I didn’t. She didn’t say nothing. I would havenever…”</p><p>Albrecht interrupted. “I know you didn’t know Willie. That’s why Ibrought her out here. I wanted her to learn what being a servant wisreally like. What I did not think is that she would keep quiet and dothe work. I expected her to come storming back to the house flinginghorse apples hours ago.”</p><p>“She did fling some at me.” Willie said, “But it was accidental, and sheflung more on herself anyway.”</p><p>“And she did work hard?” Albrecht asked.</p><p>“Harder than I did me first day.” Willie said. It was an exaggeration,but Willie was generous that way.</p><p>“Well, well Willie. Looks like both Mietzie and I learned some importantthings today.” Albrecht leaned over and gently jogged his sister’sshoulder. She stirred and asked sleepily, “Time to muck some more?”Then, “Albrecht, what are you doing here?”</p><p>“No more mucking today little sister. Let’s get you home, washed up, andthese hands looked at.”</p><p>“But, Willie and I aren’t done.”</p><p>“Well,” Willie said, “Actually, we are. I let you sleep, and things kindof go faster when you’re’nt helping. But you’re welcome to help if youwant to.”</p><p>“That’s nice Willie. Maybe later.”</p><p>A very sleepy, aching Mietzie began to walk toward the castle.</p><p>Willie looked up at Albrecht, “I ain’t goin get in trouble for workinher like that, am I Albrecht. Oh, She must hate me so. I kinda thought.Well … never mind, but am I in trouble Albrecht? I only did what youtold me.”</p><p>“You are not in trouble Willie. In fact I owe you a favor. And anotherfact: not only do I not think Mietzie hates you, I’ll bet you now have afriend in high places.” And with that Albrecht trotted to catch up tohis sister. He put his arm around her shoulders. A gesture he used to dowhen he was younger, but that he had come to feel undignified when heturned 17. Now he didn’t care. It again felt right.</p></root><a href="chapter7.html">Prior Chapter Service</a><p><a href="chapter9.html">Next Chapter Self-Defense</a></p></body></html>
