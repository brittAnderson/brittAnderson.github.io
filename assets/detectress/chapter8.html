Stunned and open<br/>mouthed, she hastily dropped into a bow. Wisps of white hair worked<br/>their way loose with this uncommonly quick maneuver. The cook’s right<br/>shoulder made mini-spasms as she began to reach up to adjust her loose<br/>hairs, remembered she was before a royal, and stopped. Then she would<br/>feel the tickle of her hair and began to reach again. Then she would<br/>remember the royal, and so on. Then she smelled the sausage beginning to<br/>burn, and again she remembered the royal.</p><p>Albrecht opened his mouth to speak, and a bell tinkled. He closed his<br/>mouth. Opened it again, and again there was a tinkling sound. Though<br/>this time it was of a higher pitch. Nonplussed, Albrecht forgot himself,<br/>and spoke normally.</p><p>“Madam, your sausage is burning.”</p><p>Cook took this as permission to rise. With a practiced movement she<br/>wrapped her hand in her apron, slid the heavy cast iron skillet to one<br/>side and then made a quick spastic jerk that set all the sausages on a<br/>roll. She arrested their roll with another quick movement and their<br/>uncooked sides were now against the skillet. Albrecht admired her skill.<br/>Again, Albrecht made ready to speak. Again, he was interrupted by<br/>tinkling bells.</p><p>“Madam …” he paused - no bells. “Madam …” A low tinkle, and then a<br/>high tinkle. He decided to ignore them. “Madam. Her Highness the Queen<br/>has decided that she would like her daughter Mietzie to learn certain<br/>domestic skills and…”</p><p>Bells began to toll in alternation low and high, and now the two<br/>original peals where joined in chorus by two more, one each of a lower<br/>and higher note than before. If Albrecht had been able to ignore the<br/>bells before, it became impossible now. He had been practicing his<br/>speech for the last half an hour (the Queen had never before set him a<br/>personal errand on her behalf) and he became befuddled by the clanging.<br/>“Blast it, Madam! Why are those bells ringing?”</p><p>“That would be yur bra’s and sistrs, Prince. The bell room is nest’or,<br/>and each of them tones is one of yur sib’s askin fer a tension. See fer<br/>yursel Sir.”</p><p>Albrecht turned about and followed the tinkling to its source. There on<br/>the wall hung the servants’ “glockenspiel.” Four bells near the center<br/>were jangling vigorously. Approaching, Albert saw that each was a<br/>slightly different size, and so each a slightly different pitch. The<br/>four bells that rang constantly were now joined in song by one more on<br/>each side. Sandwiched between them, and conspicuous by its stillness,<br/>was a single bell. Above that bell was a name: Mietzie. Sounding more<br/>like a twelve year old than a seventeen year old Albrecht screamed<br/>Mietzie’s name, and began to run up the stairs taking them two at a<br/>time.</p><p>As Albrecht came to the nursey hall he saw his siblings standing in<br/>their doors frowning and bickering. Some of the older children yelled<br/>for his assistance, but he passed them by with a wave on his way to<br/>Mietzie’s quarters. Angry, but too out of breath to give vent to it, he<br/>came to her door and saw four chamber maids gathered in respectful<br/>silence as Mietzie lectured them on how to make a bed. Mietzie<br/>cheerfully greeted her brother.</p><p>“Albrecht. Good morning.” Mietzie ran around the pile of bedding that<br/>she had heaped on the floor to reach the other side of her bed. There<br/>she tugged slightly at the single sheet that lay on it, and then ran<br/>back to the original side. “I think I have a natural aptitude for this<br/>work. No wonder we need so many staff. Their procedures are so<br/>inefficient. Look at this sheet. It isn’t even long enough to cover from<br/>my head to my toes. I have been trying to adjust it for the last five<br/>minutes. And none of these girls seems to have ever noticed this before.<br/>It’s a good thing I am going to train as a servant, because I will need<br/>to degrade my competencies to fit the position.”</p><p>“Mietzie. All the maids know why the sheet doesn’t fit, but being maids<br/>they don’t feel they can tell you. You have it sideways. Look.” And he<br/>grabbed the sheet, spun it about, and with a billow spread it across the<br/>bed. “Furthermore, you have brought the floor to a standstill. Breakfast<br/>is burning. The staff is idle. And our brothers and sisters are playing<br/>Quasimodo with the downstairs message bells. Please do not help anymore<br/>for a moment.” And with a gesture of his head he signalled the staff to<br/>began their work. Two immediately left to tend to the adjacent rooms,<br/>while the two remaining practiced hands quickly tidied up the bed under<br/>Mietzie’s glowering eye.</p><p>After the staff had left, Mietzie spoke angrily to Albrecht. “If they<br/>had known I was doing it wrong, they should have told me instead of<br/>standing there like an audience at the opera.” Mietzie did not like the<br/>opera. “I had been practicing for an hour before they got here, and I<br/>did it right every time. I just got confused when they were all watching<br/>me.”</p><p>Albrecht smiled. He respected his sister’s enthusiasm. “Mietzie, of<br/>course they didn’t tell you. We have trained the staff to be silent and<br/>respectful. None of these women will feel comfortable correcting you.”</p><p>“What about Monsieur Franz?”</p><p>“Well, he is a tutor. His role as a servant is to question and to teach,<br/>but even he is narrow in his practice. He will chide your isosceles<br/>triangle, but not your manners, or your opinion on the household. And he<br/>doesn’t know how to be a personal servant himself, so he cannot teach<br/>you how to be one.”</p><p>“But then how can I learn? ’Gina needs me.”</p><p>Albrecht had his doubts about that, but kept those to himself. The<br/>silence of the watching maids had been a lesson for him if not for<br/>Mietzie.</p><p>“Yes. How will you learn to be a servant? We need someone to teach you<br/>to do what is to be done when you are told to do it. We need someone who<br/>has not been taught to keep silent when a royal approaches. Someone<br/>obediant, but unschooled in the ways of the household, someone … like<br/>Willie. Sister, change your shoes to boots. I have the perfect teacher<br/>to instruct you in the ways of servitude.”</p><p>Half an hour later Albrecht led Mietzie across the large back lawn<br/>toward the riding stables. There he introduced her to Willie. Willie was<br/>standing in a horse stall with a shovel in his hands. He was small for<br/>his age, which Mietzie would have guessed as about the same as her own.<br/>He beamed a smile, and his blond hair went in every direction. He wore a<br/>dirty shirt with an old fashioned knotted collar under some sort of<br/>military jacket that was clearly much too big. His pants where nearly<br/>invisible because the hem of the jacket scrapped the top of the high<br/>boots he wore.</p><p>“Willie. This is Mietzie.” Albrecht purposely avoided referring to her<br/>as Princess Mietzie. “She needs to learn some basic skills for being a<br/>servant, and I have brought her here for your instruction.”</p><p>Willie’s smile broadened. “Sure thing Prince.” His voice was easy and<br/>musical. He showed respect, but not deference with his attitude. “And<br/>there is no time like the present. Here you go Mitz’.” And he extended<br/>his arm to offer her the shovel, while he stepped back out of the stall.<br/>“Start by scooping these apples into that barrow.”</p><p>Mietzie turned to her brother, but before she could speak he<br/>interjected. “You heard the boy Mitz’. Start shoveling apples. I’ll be<br/>back to check on your progress later. Thanks, Willie.”</p><p>Mietzie was stunned by the rapidity of this transition, and her brother<br/>had already turned and started to walk away when she managed to sputter<br/>out her question. “What kind of apples grow in stables?”</p><p>“Not the kind you would want to eat I’ll guarantee you. Now come on. We<br/>don’t have all day. Start shoveling.” And Willie scaled the stable’s<br/>side to sit himself on the highest rung.</p><p>Mietzie cautiously entered the stable holding the shovel out before her<br/>as a weapon.</p><p>“Their not the kind that bite either.” said Willie.</p><p>“There are no apples in here there is only horse …” she sought for a<br/>sufficiently genteel, but still accurate, word. “droppings.”</p><p>“We call them apples.” Willie said with a laugh. “And they need to go in<br/>that barrow. You must have spent all your life working inside not to<br/>know that. I guess you must have really cheesed one of the indoors<br/>bigwigs to get sent out here.”</p><p>And Mietzie looked up to see the her brother’s now small figure walking<br/>back across the lawn toward the castle. “Yes. I guess I must have.” And<br/>then she bent over and gently slid her spade under one small dropping.</p><p>“They don’t move either.” Willie said. “Go faster.” And he laughed when<br/>she frowned at him. “You can give me snake eyes all you want sister, but<br/>when you get sent down to learn how to muck stalls I know I ain’t got<br/>much to be a feared of.”</p><p>“I’m not mad at you. I am mad at …” and then Mietzie realized all at<br/>once that Willie did not know she was a Princess “him.” And she used a<br/>flip of her head to gesture at Albrecht.</p><p>“Oh, he isn’t a bad one as royals go. Always treats me fair, and he<br/>knows his horses. Not like some of the others that treats ’em like they<br/>were disposable. Prince Albrecht rides them with respect, and he sits a<br/>fine horse. Now seriously, let’s go or we won’t get done. I’ll show you<br/>once. You’re just using your arms. You’ll get too tired that way. Back<br/>and legs. Back and legs.” He jumped down, took the shovel, and made two<br/>smooth swoops into the wheelbarrow. “Now you try.” And he jumped back up<br/>to his perch on the top rung of the stable’s wall.</p><p>Channeling her anger into her motions, Mietzie tried to imitate Willie’s<br/>smooth motion, but instead of landing her scoop into the barrow she<br/>accidentally sprayed an arc around the stable. She streaked her dress<br/>and painted a line on the stable wall that crossed Willie’s boots.<br/>Gazing, horrified at herself and at Willie’s boots, she stammered out an<br/>apology.</p><p>Willie was laughing again. “I shoulda seen that coming. No worries.<br/>That’s why we wear boots and take a weekly bath. Now keep at it. I’ll go<br/>get another shovel and we’ll work on it together.”</p><p>They finished mucking the stall together, and then they each began on<br/>another. Willie took charge of moving the horses from the dirty stalls<br/>to the clean ones while Mietzie continued to shovel. He also tried not<br/>to make her feel bad, but he still did four stables in the time it took<br/>her to do one.</p><p>“Now we put in fresh hay, and this isn’t apple picking anymore. This<br/>’fork will put a hole through your foot the size of a finger, so be<br/>careful.” And after Willie handed her the pitchfork he watched her<br/>carefully. He was attentive and mimed the motions necessary for Mietzie<br/>to safely stab a bunch of hay and discharge it into a cleaned stable.<br/>When Mietzie had done one stable, Willie brought her with him to place<br/>her hand along side his as they led a large, beautiful horse back into<br/>its clean stall. Willie spoke to the horse as they walked. Willie calmly<br/>mumbled little nothing phrases as he gently patted the side of the<br/>horse’s neck with his freehand.</p><p>“This is Albrecht’s horse.” Willie told her after she had latched the<br/>stable gate. “And now we get a break. Did they give you anything for<br/>lunch before they kicked you out of the big house? No? Well, I guess we<br/>can share mine today, but I’ll get the stable master to let ’em know<br/>that if they are going to keep sending you down here they got to feed<br/>you.”</p><p>“Because the apples aren’t very nutritious are they.” Mietzie said with<br/>a tired smile as they sat on a stack of fresh hay by the main door into<br/>the stables.</p><p>“Well I don’t know what tritious means, but no, I wouldn’t want to dine<br/>on them apples.” Willie laughed with her.</p><p>“It is very generous of you to share your lunch with me.” And Mietzie<br/>meant it, but she was having a little trouble figuring how to begin<br/>eating the hunk of bread she held in one hand or the small share of cold<br/>beef congealed in fat she held in the other.</p><p>“We staff have to stick together. That’s all. Fairs fair. We can’t just<br/>ring a bell whenever we’re hungry can we?” Mietzie’s faced reddened when<br/>he said this.</p><p>“And even if we could,” Mietzie said, “maybe we shouldn’t.”</p><p>Willie took a big bite of his beef, and with his mouth full said to her,<br/>“What you waitin’ for Mitz? Knife and fork?” and Willie laughed again</p><p>While Willie munched away, Mietzie cautiously nibbled at the bit of<br/>bread she held. She did not have her usual appetite, and returned the<br/>hunk of meat to Willie with thanks. As they ate, she asked him, “Why do<br/>you do this Willie. Work so hard for cold meat and boots caked in …<br/>stable stuff.”</p><p>“<b>Stable stuff.</b> I like that. Well what else would I do, starve? You<br/>want to eat. You got to work. And I like horses, and the big house<br/>treats me fair. Sometimes the horses need exercising when the house is<br/>away, and sometimes they let me help with that. No one else I know has<br/>ever ridden a horse for anything but plowin. I get to ride for pleasure.<br/>And they treat me fair here. No one hits me as long as I do as they tell<br/>me. Do they hit you in the big house?”</p><p>“No. I have never been hit in the big house.” Mietzie replied, but<br/>wondered if there had been times that she may have deserved it. “It’s<br/>easy to forget about here, when you are in there.”</p><p>“Oh. Don’t fret. Albrecht is fair. I’ll bet they have you back at your<br/>old job before you know it. Least ways cause you’re not very good at<br/>this one.”</p><p>Mietzie laughed with him, and leaned her head back into the straw to<br/>rest until they had to start again.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>When Willie saw Albrecht start across the lawn he went out to meet him,<br/>and spoke quietly. “Prince Albrecht. I don’t think you should keep that<br/>girl you brought out here in the stables. She ain’t suited to it.”</p><p>“Giving you too much trouble too, Willie?”</p><p>“No. She works hard. She just ain’t trained to it. She fell asleep at<br/>lunch, and when I went to wake her I saw her hands were all bloody. I<br/>shouldn’t’a made her do so much shoveling I guess, but I ain’t never<br/>known anyone with hands that dainty. How could she do any washing or<br/>cleanin without her gettin a bit more sturdy? So, I was worried, and I<br/>let her sleep.”</p><p>Willie and Albrecht walked together to stand by Mietzie sleeping on the<br/>hay stack. “She does work hard Willie. She just has a very different job<br/>than you, and it isn’t one that has had her cleaning or washing or<br/>mucking. She’s actually my sister, Princess Mietzie.”</p><p>“Oh. Oh. Oh.” Willie jogged in a circle while repeating “Oh.” “I didn’t<br/>know Albrecht. Honest I didn’t. She didn’t say nothing. I would have<br/>never…”</p><p>Albrecht interrupted. “I know you didn’t know Willie. That’s why I<br/>brought her out here. I wanted her to learn what being a servant wis<br/>really like. What I did not think is that she would keep quiet and do<br/>the work. I expected her to come storming back to the house flinging<br/>horse apples hours ago.”</p><p>“She did fling some at me.” Willie said, “But it was accidental, and she<br/>flung more on herself anyway.”</p><p>“And she did work hard?” Albrecht asked.</p><p>“Harder than I did me first day.” Willie said. It was an exaggeration,<br/>but Willie was generous that way.</p><p>“Well, well Willie. Looks like both Mietzie and I learned some important<br/>things today.” Albrecht leaned over and gently jogged his sister’s<br/>shoulder. She stirred and asked sleepily, “Time to muck some more?”<br/>Then, “Albrecht, what are you doing here?”</p><p>“No more mucking today little sister. Let’s get you home, washed up, and<br/>these hands looked at.”</p><p>“But, Willie and I aren’t done.”</p><p>“Well,” Willie said, “Actually, we are. I let you sleep, and things kind<br/>of go faster when you’re’nt helping. But you’re welcome to help if you<br/>want to.”</p><p>“That’s nice Willie. Maybe later.”</p><p>A very sleepy, aching Mietzie began to walk toward the castle.</p><p>Willie looked up at Albrecht, “I ain’t goin get in trouble for workin<br/>her like that, am I Albrecht. Oh, She must hate me so. I kinda thought.<br/>Well … never mind, but am I in trouble Albrecht? I only did what you<br/>told me.”</p><p>“You are not in trouble Willie. In fact I owe you a favor. And another<br/>fact: not only do I not think Mietzie hates you, I’ll bet you now have a<br/>friend in high places.” And with that Albrecht trotted to catch up to<br/>his sister. He put his arm around her shoulders. A gesture he used to do<br/>when he was younger, but that he had come to feel undignified when he<br/>turned 17. Now he didn’t care. It again felt right.</p></root><a href="chapter7.html">Prior Chapter Service</a><p><a href="chapter9.html">Next Chapter Self-Defense</a></p></body></html>
