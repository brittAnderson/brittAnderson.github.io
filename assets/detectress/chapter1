There were two reasons for this: One, it was a<br/>very, very large palace; And two, there were two realms within the<br/>palace. There was the lower realm. It was the servants’ world. It was a<br/>warren of pantries and sculleries; work shops and storage rooms; small<br/>sleeping quarters; and deep and dark basements shuttered behind large,<br/>locked and rusting doors.</p><p><b>Almost</b> no one had been in all the rooms of the palace. But the Queen<br/>had. She toured from top to bottom. She inspected. She observed. She did<br/>this not only because it was <b>her</b> palace, but because it was also her<br/>family’s <b>home</b>, and it was her nation’s trust.</p><p>It was on one such tour day, unannounced and unexpected, that a young<br/>child was hurriedly shunted aside and instructed to amuse herself. The<br/>child was directed to a small side room with a small table, a room used<br/>for the occasional servant’s break. It was the room for a quick pipe or<br/>a cup of tea, a bit of gossip or a moan about one’s feet, a communal<br/>sigh or a shared weary silence. The child was given a stub of pencil and<br/>a large piece of butcher’s paper recently used, but mostly unsoiled, and<br/>completely dry. Such things were saved for the young girl. She was used<br/>to being shunted aside and entertaining herself. Her mother’s life at<br/>the Palace was a hard, busy and tiring one.</p><p>Absorbed in her art the young girl noticed neither the hush that fell<br/>outside the doorway nor the silhouette of the large figure that filled<br/>that doorway, but she did look up when the figure passed inside the<br/>small room. The young girl cheerfully said, “Oh. Hello.”</p><p>The silhouette replied, “Hello to you. What are you doing, may I ask?”</p><p>“I am drawing a picture.” After her initial glance up the little girl<br/>had lowered her head and her gaze back down. The little girl knew she<br/>must answer grown-up questions politely, but her work was quite<br/>absorbing.</p><p>“Of what are you drawing a picture?” the tall silhouette asked.</p><p>“The Boss Lady who runs this place.”</p><p>“May I see her?”</p><p>The child sat up, and slid her drawing towards the older woman who now<br/>leaned over the table to study it. The woman observed for a moment, and<br/>then straightened up while asking: “Isn’t it unusual that the person in<br/>your picture should be floating in the air when everyone else is on the<br/>ground?”</p><p>“No. She’s a highness person.”</p><p>“Oh.” the older woman said, and strained to hide her smile. “That makes<br/>sense. But why is she dressed that way?”</p><p>The dress of the figure in the drawing was not too easily seen, such was<br/>the young child’s art, but it was clear that it was large, black,<br/>severe, and, one could infer, uncomfortable.</p><p>The child replied, “Because she is mean.”</p><p>“She is is she?” The Queen’s feelings were not hurt. She knew that life<br/>as a servant, whether for the Queen or for other people, often led to<br/>the occasional bitter feeling that would sour if not expressed. But the<br/>Queen had to suppress another smile when she reflected on the silent<br/>household behind her in the hall listening to their conversation. The<br/>Queen did not intend to prolong their discomfort, and was preparing to<br/>leave the child when she asked one last teasing question. “She looks<br/>like me don’t you think?”</p><p>“No.” The child was emphatic. The strength of the rejection surprised<br/>the Queen. This Queen was not often surprised. She enjoyed the feeling.</p><p>“Why not? Because I am not a <b>highness</b>?” asked the Queen.</p><p>“No. Because you’re not mean. You’re nice.” And the young girl smiled at<br/>her.</p><p>“And you my dear are a very genuine and pleasant young lady with whom to<br/>speak.”</p><p>The young girl beamed. She had never been called a lady before. Only the<br/>upstairs people were <b>ladies</b>. She jumped from her chair with a quick<br/>shout of “Mama” as a prelude to sharing the news. Then the young girl<br/>froze. She realized suddenly that she had been speaking with an upstairs<br/>person. The young girl grew afraid. When her moment of startle passed<br/>the young girl ran out of the room to clutch the apron of a young woman<br/>who had been standing quietly by, head bowed.</p><p>Her Majesty left the room with a quick word to the aide outside: “Grab<br/>that picture.” The Queen followed the young girl to where she now stood<br/>half hidden by her mother’s apron. With one curious eye the young girl<br/>stared back at the Queen.</p><p>The Queen addressed the young girl’s mother. “You have an exceptional<br/>child.” The young mother blushed, but did not otherwise move. “She is<br/>four I would estimate?” There was a slight nod from the young mother.<br/>“When she is 10 I wish to see her again. Do you understand?” Another<br/>short nod, but now the expression changed to one of confusion. “Yes, I<br/>know it would not normally be easy, but this is my secretary Mr.<br/>Goldthread.” The Queen indicated the returning aide who held in his gray<br/>gloved hands the butcher paper art neatly folded. “He has heard my<br/>instructions. He will monitor your daughter’s progress and he will see<br/>to the arrangements. You need only let your superiors know when it is<br/>time, and word will be passed to Mr. Goldthread. He will confirm the<br/>arrangements. Until then, please keep doing what you are doing, because<br/>as a mother you excel, and I know how hard that job is.<br/>Congratulations.”</p><p>A rustle passed through the silent, still staff. They found it<br/>increasingly difficult to keep their excitement bottled up. The young<br/>mother could not resist a quick breach of protocol and glanced up<br/>smiling. She was met with a smiling glance down. It was a shared moment<br/>between mothers.</p><p>When the Queen finally passed through the last doorway that marked the<br/>border between upstairs and downstairs, and when the echo of the last<br/>latch clicking shut echoed down the silent stairwell, there erupted in<br/>the downstairs hall a loud Hurrah.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The household could now be said to have two Queens: an upstairs Queen -<br/>known as such to the world, and a downstairs’ Queen - one attentively<br/>served by her mother, friends, and all the staff. The little girl had<br/>always been a favorite, but now became favored as well. She was allowed<br/>on late night inspections with valets who taught her the back<br/>passageways and the little known routes for navigating the house. As she<br/>grew the young girl was taught how the men and women of the upstairs<br/>dressed. She learned the names of the strange contents and devices that<br/>comprised the upstairs world, but were seldom seen below. Some days were<br/>kitchen days. On those days the young girl was instructed through<br/>exposure and by example the right way to make preserves, cook geese,<br/>what make a scone worthy of the name, and how to recognize when the<br/>pudding is done by listening to the pitch of the hiss from the steamer.</p><p>The growing girl learned mathematics by checking accounts, which were<br/>done by a former cleric, now atheist, who was also a happily married<br/>second butler. This cleric turned butler made teaching the little girl<br/>her ciphers his special project. She was a quick learner, and he soon<br/>moved on to include reading and writing as part of her instruction. The<br/>butler asked a friend who still tended a parish for materials. The<br/>friend sent back a full set of worn, but legible, McGuffey readers.<br/>These gifts to the church would continue doing service in the downstairs<br/>of the Queen’s household. The girl loved the stories. She read through<br/>each of them many times. Once she was done she would begin again. She<br/>could be heard roaming the halls or helping with the dusting while all<br/>the time citing remembered passages from Virgil or the label of Puff’s<br/>Baking Powder. Obedience came naturally to one who wanted so much to<br/>please. Even her diction was a subject for instruction. This was<br/>addressed by Mr. Goldthread on his occasional visits. His passing no<br/>longer disturbed the staff. They now viewed him as an ally in their<br/>project. All the downstairs adults were well aware of when the girl<br/>turned seven. When she passed from eight to nine she could feel the<br/>change too.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>When they day came for her official visit she was fussed over and<br/>primped. She wore a beautiful dress that had been made collaboratively<br/>by her mother and the Queen’s own seamstress from scraps of clothing<br/>that were the residue of <b>upstairs’</b> projects. The girl was even taught<br/>to stitch the hem herself.</p><p>The young girl stood now waiting in the hushed downstairs for Mr.<br/>Goldthread to escort her. Quiet and expressionless Mr.Goldthread arrived<br/>and then guided her to a distant room in the royal family’s private<br/>wing. Now there was no butcher paper with which she could distract<br/>herself. There was no cozy pantry break-room into which she could take<br/>refuge. On this occasion she did not have her hallway of silent friends<br/>and guardians, the downstairs staff, watching and rooting for her. Now<br/>the young girl was alone. She stood still and rigid in her pretty but<br/>itchy new dress. And she waited, all alone, in a very large, very<br/>bright, very quiet room.</p><p>Soon there paraded in bouncing and chattering children. They took places<br/>in front of chairs and chaises. They stared at the little girl, or so it<br/>felt to her. The young girl assumed their vigorous whispers were about<br/>her, for she saw that her new dress was pale indeed in comparison to the<br/>finery of the Queen’s own family. Then there was quiet. The Queen<br/>entered. She came and stood before the young girl who, well rehearsed,<br/>went down on one knee and bowed her head. The young girl heard the<br/>command to rise and looked up. Though she had spied the Queen many times<br/>before (on her rounds to help the staff and when exploring back hallways<br/>with under butlers) the face that met her gaze seemed more severe. The<br/>little girl felt the intensity of the Queen’s inspection.</p><p>“Hello young lady.” There was only friendliness in the Queen’s greeting,<br/>but the young girl responded only with silence and a bow of her head.<br/>She offered a competent, if miniature, curtsy. The Queen frowned. The<br/>Queen had feared this change. The downstairs staff, with all their well<br/>intentioned preparations, had stifled the girl. Now she feared the<br/>Queen, as did they all. The Queen was angry at how, she thought, they<br/>had turned the free and intelligent child she had so looked forward to<br/>meeting into another respectful living doll.</p><p>“Why don’t you speak to me?” the Queen asked with her annoyance evident<br/>in her voice. The girl’s face screwed up in discomfort. One hand wrung<br/>the other. She crossed her legs at the ankle binding herself into<br/>silence. Finally there exploded a huge exhalation. The girl blurted,<br/>“I’m not allowed to talk to you until you give me a mission. He said<br/>it!” Pointing at Mr. Goldthread she clamped herself into silence again.</p><p>The Queen turned in confusion to her secretary. Mr. Goldthread said,<br/>“What I told her your Majesty was that she should wait to speak until<br/>she had been given <b>permission</b>. I believe she took me a bit too<br/>literally, and we may have lost a rather important syllable.”</p><p>With a nod, the Queen turned again to the young girl, “Here is your<br/>mission: speak to me as we did those years before. Do you remember that<br/>at all?”</p><p>“Oh yes Majesty. You stole my picture.”</p><p>“Yes I did,” said the Queen. The Queen’s children laughed for a moment,<br/>and then they too grew silent when the Queen focused on them in turn her<br/>inspecting gaze. “I apologize for that. I should have asked. Would you<br/>like to do something today to make up for it?”</p><p>“We could play?”</p><p>“What would we play?”</p><p>“Tea!” shouted the young girl with excitement.</p><p>“Yes. Let’s all play tea,” answered the Queen. The Queen’s movement was<br/>echoed by all in the room. All moved together towards the tea things.<br/>Unexpectedly the little girl’s lip again began to quiver. Her expression<br/>became fearful.</p><p>Now, with an attitude more motherly than regal, the Queen knelt down<br/>before the little girl and put her hands on both the girl’s arms. The<br/>Queen looked the young girl directly in the face and asked in a soft<br/>voice, “What is wrong?”</p><p>“I only know how to play with two people,” the girl whispered back.<br/>“That’s all he ever showed me,” And she again pointed at Mr. Goldthread.</p><p>“Well,” said the Queen rising again. “Mr. Goldthread has been remiss in<br/>your education,” but she smiled as she said it. “We will rectify that<br/>forthwith. Let us all go to play tea.” And with the small girl’s little<br/>hand inside her own, they walked together to the table.</p></root><a href="chapter2">
