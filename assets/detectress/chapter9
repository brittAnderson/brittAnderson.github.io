<body><h2>Chapter - Self-Defense</h2><p>As Regina’s enrollment date for the new school approached her lessons<br/>with Monsieur Franz grew more regular, prolonged, and intense. And they<br/>became less fun. There were no more fanciful days exploring the<br/>implications of Euclid’s axioms (including that odd parallel one) or<br/>taking field trips in which she played the part of a young Linnaeus<br/>classifying dicotyledons. Regina and Monsieur Franz still practiced<br/>French, as that was the parlor language of the aristocratic and<br/>diplomatic classes. Membership in the upstairs world required sufficient<br/>knowledge to chuckle appropriately at the young men’s latest <b>bon mot</b>.<br/>Even her history lessons had been degraded by her upcoming academic<br/>placement: From the vast and admirable personages of 5000 years of human<br/>history, Regina was now reduced to memorizing the family trees of<br/>contemporary notables. Each wayward cousin of some significant (mostly<br/>by birth, but occasionally through merit) someone-or-other knew every<br/>other. It was this web of recognition that served the function of a<br/>password for their aristocratic set. If Regina was to spring fully<br/>formed into society, if her charade was to have any chance of<br/>succeeding, she must have a familiarity with all the players, and so she<br/>studied the Clarences, Esmereldas, and Hunkerstein-Filipowiczs that<br/>seemed to make up a disproportionate share of nobles; and who had the<br/>unfortunate practice of reusing and recombining given names so that it<br/>was necessary to distinguish Clarence Alex von Hunkerstein from Alex<br/>Clarence Hunkerstein-Filipowicz. They in turn must be distinguished from<br/>the many sisters and cousins who regularly swapped Clarice for Clarence<br/>and Alexis for Alex. And then there were the children, hybrid sons and<br/>daughters of all the Clarences, Alexes, Alexises, and Clarices that<br/>blossomed into new hyphenated variants. And that was just the Prussian<br/>branch.</p><p>Today, again, Regina and Monsieur Franz sat in the small pantry<br/>classroom while he guided her through another branch of another family<br/>tree. Regina sketched the “exalted” personages on a small slate. Seeing<br/>the shape of the tree helped her to remember and trace the connections.<br/>She was engrossed in one such lineage when a shadow fell across her<br/>chalk and slate and she heard Monsieur Franz speak in greeting.</p><p>“Ah, Herren Stoll und Gafner. Swiss Time. Forgive me and my pupil for<br/>not being completely finished. I should have anticipated your<br/>punctuality.”</p><p>Looking up Regina saw two of the Swiss Guards. These were the two she<br/>had first seen at tea. Gray clad, fit but not bulky, they filled the<br/>small doorway in both its vertical and horizontal dimensions. They<br/>responded with grunted <b>Genau</b>s.</p><p>Monsieur Franz continued. “I had requested tea for your arrival. I<br/>thought it might help us ease into the lesson.” And then in a louder<br/>voice, “Cook, could you have the tea brought in please?”</p><p>As these preparations were made, the two Swiss came into the room and<br/>took two places at the small writing table that functioned as bench,<br/>demonstration platform, writing table, desk, and, as now, tea table. The<br/>service was set quickly, and after Cook had left Monsieur Franz<br/>continued with introductions.</p><p>“Regina. I understand that you have seen these two gentlemen before.<br/>This is Herr Hans Gafner and is associate Herr René Stoll. As you know,<br/>they are part of the complement of the Queen’s guards. Although it is<br/>most likely unnecessary, Her Majesty has asked that you be provided with<br/>additional instruction in self-defense. Likely unnecessary. Of course…<br/>but, one should be prepared for even unlikely eventualities. And so,<br/>here they are; to participate in the instruction.” Monsieur Franz seemed<br/>nervous discussing this topic. He distracted himself by beginning to<br/>pour the tea while asking after preferences for milk or sugar.</p><p>“Herr Franz is correct as to our assignment,” said Herr Gafner “but with<br/>such a short time for preparation we must focus on the practical more<br/>than the technical. There is no time to make you a master of Judo or the<br/>Vougle, as we will if your education in defense is to continue, but we<br/>can emphasize certain useful tactics.” At this point Herr Stoll reached<br/>into a pocket and took out a cube of sugar and extended his arm towards<br/>Regina. “This sugar cube is one of several we will provide you with. It<br/>has been saturated with a tasteless sedative that acts very rapidly. It<br/>is not deadly, but it does incapacitate, and while there is an agent<br/>that can rapidly reverse its effects there will be no need for you to<br/>have that. But be assured it is safe, though effective. You may not be<br/>able to disable an adversary through force, but if you can trick them<br/>into consuming one of these you will have achieved the same effect. And<br/>that is to be your first lesson, the one we will practice today, how to<br/>trick a person into such consumption.”</p><p>Regina reached forward to take the offered sugar cube from Herr Stoll,<br/>and there was a tremor in her right hand. Her clumsy and nervous reach<br/>caused her to bump the table sending the hot tea in the gentlemen’s cups<br/>cascading in waves over their rims and saucers to drip into their laps.<br/>The three men abruptly stood wiping at the stains, while Regina<br/>apologized with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Pas de problem.” said Herr Stoll. “It is a rather frightening prospect<br/>to imagine oneself incapacitating another, but you will come to master<br/>it through our supervision and practice.”</p><p>“Bien sûr!” said Monsieur Franz after a sip of his tea. “Regina is very<br/>capable. Very creative. I am sure she will master her nerves and perform<br/>whatever lessons you have for her.” And he took another sip of tea. Both<br/>of the Swiss guards picked up their cups and made to do the same when<br/>they looked at Regina, then looked at each other, and then with the<br/>faintest of smiles looked back at Regina while placing their teacups<br/>back onto the saucers. “I think we agree with Monsieur Franz. You are a<br/>very capable young student.” Monsieur Franz smiled proudly while sipping<br/>his tea. “Tell me Regina.” Herr Gafner continued, “What do you think is<br/>one effective way to get someone to take this sedative without their<br/>knowing?”</p><p>“Put it in something they might eat or drink?”</p><p>“And how would you do that without their noticing?”</p><p>“Create a distraction, maybe?”</p><p>“Yes. Create a distraction. That was to be our first lesson, but I<br/>believe you have already mastered that, haven’t you Regina? Regina show<br/>us the sugar cube Herr Stoll gave you.”</p><p>But before Regina could respond all three heard Monsieur Franz emit a<br/>very loud “Oh my, I don’t feel well.” And it was only a very quick<br/>action on the part of Herr Stoll that kept Monsieur Franz’s face from<br/>planting itself on the table. With Herr Stoll tilting Monsieur Franz<br/>back so that his lips parted slightly Herr Gafner reached into another<br/>pocket and took out a small brown vial with an eye dropper in the lid.<br/>He used it to slowly drop five drops onto Monsieur Franz’s tongue.<br/>Within a few seconds there was a loud snort as if Monsieur Franz was<br/>awakened from sleep by his own snoring. Herr Stoll released his support,<br/>and Monsieur Franz slowly shook his head from side to side as he<br/>regained his wits. “Oh Regina.” he sighed audibly disappointed.</p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose!” she protested. “I was trying to get to his<br/>cup.” Regina gestured toward Herr Stoll. “But you took the wrong one.”</p><p>Monsieur Franz made no response, but stood slowly, and with shaky<br/>dignity, “Regina. It is most important that you succeed in your tasks,<br/>and I can only guess there is an element of danger involved if such<br/>means are viewed to be a necessary part of your preparation. Therefore,<br/>I can bear you no ill will, but I will excuse myself from any further<br/>participation in these lessons.” And then, cautiously, and with one hand<br/>trailing along the wall, he left the room.</p><p>The two Guards watched him go. “Ein guter Mensch,” said Herr Gafner.<br/>“Genau,” responded Herr Stoll.</p><p>“Now Regina. We will assume you have mastered the distraction lesson,<br/>and that you do not need further instruction from us on that front. You<br/>have also observed the effects of the sedative, and know now how<br/>cautious you must be. Here are six more sugar cubes. Keep them safe, and<br/>keep them hidden.” Herr Stoll handed her what looked like a small box of<br/>matches, and in doing so he briefly slid the lid open to reveal the<br/>cubes packed tightly inside. “Now, perhaps you will tell us how it is<br/>you came to master this distraction lesson on your own?”</p><p>“Oh. It was not on my own. Jimmie taught me. He is one of the footmen.<br/>He grew up in a carnival family. He does magic and showed me how a<br/>little distraction allowed you to do tricks right under people’s noses.<br/>I spent a lot of time with Jimmie when I was little. He is fun.”</p><p>“And were there any other carnival skills you learned from Jimmie?”</p><p>“I can kind of throw a knife a little bit.”</p><p>The two Guards turned to face each other again, and again turned back to<br/>look at Regina with what seemed to be just the trace of a smile.<br/>“Perhaps you would demonstrate this for us.” While saying this Herr<br/>Stoll gestured to a wooden post exposed in the wall between and behind<br/>them. Herr Gafner removed from a small sheath on the outside of his boot<br/>a short, flat bladed knife. He handed it to Regina handle first. She<br/>took it and reversed it to hold it with a light grasp on the flat part<br/>of the blade away from the edges. Then, with a deft little flick, she<br/>sent the knife flying between the two men’s heads (and neither flinched)<br/>to softly embed itself in the wood.</p><p>“You would not kill a man with that, but it not a skill one would expect<br/>you to possess, and therefore it could come in very handy. However, on<br/>this mission it would not look right to have you showing up wearing a<br/>throwing knife. Should the occasion arise, I will have boots and blades<br/>made for you, but let us hope that day does not come.” Despite the<br/>words, his voice seemed to hint that in fact he hoped such days did<br/>ensue. It was Regina’s secret, romantic wish that such days might<br/>happen. She was rather infatuated with the idea of sporting a knife in<br/>her shoes just like the Swiss Guards.</p><p>“Perhaps Herr Stoll, we will focus on the final lesson. You are small<br/>Regina. You are obviously capable, but if a trained man were to attack<br/>you, you would not be able to overcome him. However, an untrained man is<br/>another matter. There, surprise might be enough. Such a man is likely to<br/>come at you from behind, so we have three strategies. First, you scream<br/>if you can. Most people seeing a man grab a girl will assume the man<br/>evil if they hear you scream and they will come to your aid. Knowing<br/>this, the man will try to cover your mouth. To make him release you you<br/>will stamp on his foot as hard as you can. Come here.”</p><p>As Regina rose to come around the table Herr Gafner stood and pulled up<br/>the cuffs of his pants to show that he was wearing two different boots.<br/>He gestured to the one on his right foot. “This is the practice boot,<br/>Regina. Remember that. It is a special practice boot. It has two metal<br/>bands under the leather that are slightly separated, and there is a<br/>small battery and a small buzzer. If you stomp down on this boot hard<br/>enough you can make the two pieces of metal touch, and the buzzer will<br/>ring. Let’s try.” And before Regina had time to react or scream she was<br/>gripped across the torso by a strong arm, while the other hand clamped<br/>across her mouth and nose making it impossible to breath. She started<br/>trying to tap the foot she knew was below her. There. She felt it. “We<br/>are not dancing Regina!” Herr Gafner sounded angry. Regina began to<br/>squirm with panic. Then she saw Herr Stoll before her. He was speaking<br/>calmly.</p><p>“No Regina. No panic. The foot. The foot. It is all you think about. The<br/>foot. Hard.” She hit it, but there was no sound. Herr Gafner growled,<br/>“How long before you faint Regina? Perhaps I was wrong. You are still<br/>too little a girl. Your mother will be so disappointed.”</p><p>Herr Stoll took her face and pointed it at his. Sweetly he said, “Do not<br/>listen to the man who has you. Do not care what the man who has you<br/>says. You are Regina, knife throwing Amazon. Now stomp on that foot!<br/>Break it.”</p><p>And Regina stopped her squirming. She closed her eyes. She felt the body<br/>holding her, the arms that wrapped her, the leg that braced itself<br/>against her, and she ’saw’ the foot in her mind’s eye. It was beneath<br/>her. Between her own two legs and she leaped up swiftly in the grasp<br/>that held her, and came down on the foot. “Ha!” She heard the grunt<br/>behind her, but still no buzz. Then Herr Stoll’s voice encouraging. “Yes<br/>Regina, that is it. Stomp it. Harder. Harder.” And Regina responded with<br/>purpose and force. Now bracing herself with one leg the other went up<br/>and down repeatedly, pounding the heel into the foot of the other.<br/>“Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.”</p><p>The arms released her. Regina bent over sucking in her breath, and she<br/>heard the two men clapping, and cheering, and her anger dissolved into<br/>pride when she saw the happiness on their faces. She sat back down onto<br/>a chair, and tried to compose herself. Her breathing slowed, and finally<br/>she could say, “Shall we try again? I seemed to take too long that<br/>time.”</p><p>The two guards smiled at her. “No. There is no need to practice that<br/>again right now. We have one last lesson, or perhaps we should say gift,<br/>or maybe award, because you have earned it.”</p><p>Herr Gafner took from his pocket a small flat box about three inches on<br/>a side. It was black velvet, and hinged on one side. He opened it to<br/>face her and she saw lying inside a small bracelet. It was a narrow<br/>silver band with an etched pattern like snakes’ scales. There were two<br/>small transverse joints where it appeared that two semi-circles of<br/>silver had been fused together and on one side there was a slight<br/>thickening as if the bracelet were a snake that had recently swallowed a<br/>prey. It was beautiful in a way, but what was more surprising to Regina<br/>was that she recognized it. The Queen wore one, always, though the<br/>Queen’s was larger. Herr Gafner took it from the box. “This,” he said<br/>“is a special product made by our Quaestor. Our local adjutant if you<br/>will. He is our leader, but he is also talented at making useful tools<br/>for us in our work. He calls this product the snake. You might think<br/>that is because of the scales, but in reality it is because that just<br/>like a snake it has fangs.” Grabbing the side of the bracelet with the<br/>bump in one hand he pulled it apart from the other side where it<br/>separated at the fine transverse joints. On the opposite side there were<br/>two small holes, and on the side with the bump, which Herr Gafner now<br/>held in his hand, there extended two short, but very sharp, needle<br/>points. “This is your weapon of last resort. If you cannot escape, and<br/>your life is at risk. Use it. Aim for the eyes.”</p><p>With those gruesome instructions Herr Gafner snapped the two rings<br/>together around her wrist, and he and Herr Stoll stood up straight. “You<br/>have done very well today Regina. But do not be over confident. We will<br/>see you here again tomorrow for more distraction, stamping, and poking<br/>practice. I have ordered grapes. We will use those to simulate eyeballs.<br/>Should your snake need to bite there can be no squeamishness. No<br/>hesitation.”</p><p>Then without pausing for her response, the two made short bows, said<br/>“Auf wiederluge.” and left her alone rubbing the silver scaly band that<br/>encircled her left wrist.</p>
