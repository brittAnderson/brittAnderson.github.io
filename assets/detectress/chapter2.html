The preceding Monday preparations began. Mr. Goldthread would predictably appear and with his unique combination of amusement and severity instruct the little girl as to acceptable and unacceptable topics of conversation. These varied depending both on affairs of state and household gossip. Thus, the little girl was informed about politics at large and local - perhaps more informed than those instructing her perceived. This week ’Gina, for they now all, both upstairs and downstairs, called her by this nickname: the diminutive for Regina; found Mr. Goldthread looking at her with an expression that when she looked at him with both eyes seemed a scold, but when she squinted at him with just one eye seemed a smile. Mr. Goldthread told ‘Gina that this week, under no circumstance, was she to 1) inquire after Lord Fauxami, 2) request information on the Maldives, or 3) speak of cats.</p><p>The first two of the three did not present any problems, but for opposite reasons. As to the Maldives she was completely ignorant, except that she knew it was a place. She had been provided with a very good atlas, and later she would locate the Maldives on it. As to Lord Fauxami, she was completely informed about occurrences. The staff <b>telegraph</b> was quite efficient. Regina knew from sources that Lord Fauxami had left the household in the company of Beatrice from housekeeping. ‘Gina always thought Beatrice silly and funny. This was because Beatrice never seemed to be able to find a uniform that fit her properly. Even when she was provided with a new uniform, a uniform that fit perfectly, ’Gina noticed that within a day or two, due to Beatrice’s bad luck, the uniform would have shrunk or been otherwise altered to such an extent that Beatrice was always forced to pull and tug to keep the odd corners of herself covered. Unfortunately, the tug that hid one bit of skin always revealed another elsewhere, and so it was that Beatrice never managed to stay completely modest. Beatrice’s work was always accompanied by a swishing, twitching mannerism that led to near calamity whenever she was required to dust the upper shelving - a responsibility from which , to her credit, she never shirked. In fact it was a responsibility for which she often volunteered.</p><p>In contrast to Beatrice’s apparel misfortunes, his Lordship Fauxami, a handsome man, was always finely dressed. ‘Gina had seen him several times through the valet spy holes. When she made rounds with the head butler it was not uncommon to come upon a group of young maids clustered about one of these peepholes. And while the head butler shooed them back to work, ’Gina took the opportunity to see what it was they had all been watching. Often it was the handsome figure of his Lordship Fauxami. ’Gina could also tell whether Beatrice was likewise in the room. If so, the finely dressed Lord would appear distressed. ’Gina felt sorry for him. Whenever Beatrice entered a room to clean his Lordship would begin to cross and uncross his legs rapidly while leafing quickly through the book or newspaper he was reading. It little surprised ‘Gina that someone as nice as his Lordship (he had patted her on the head once when she was coming back from tea) would be concerned with Beatrice’s poor fitting clothes. It also did not surprise ’Gina when she learned that the generous Fauxami had decided to take Beatrice under his wing and outfit her properly. As ‘Gina thought about this she lightly stroked the cloth and pleats of her own dress and felt in her imagination the light slickness of the satin which she would be allowed to wear on Wednesday for tea. She saw in her mind’s eye the red dress being removed from its special closet on the floor above the one where she slept with her mother.</p><p>But now ‘Gina bit her lower lip: cats! How could she not talk about cats? Cats was about the only topic she had in common with the royal family. ‘Gina had a cat, or rather there was a cat that came daily to see ‘Gina for the scraps she fed it from the pantry. Each day in the mid-afternoon the cat appeared near the pantry door hissing at anyone who was not ‘Gina. Perhaps this was because whenever the cat appeared there and ‘Gina was not around the cat’s greeting consisted of a swat with a broom and a loud shout of “Shoo! Scat!” The cat therefore had become choosy, and would sit high up on a rafter watching for ‘Gina’s approach. At which approach the cat would jump down and walk zig zag between ‘Gina’s legs guiding her to the pantry where ‘Gina always managed to use her favored status to procure some small scrap for the cat.</p><p>‘Gina called the cat “Queenie” because tufts of fur around the cat’s ears looked to ‘Gina like a little crown. When ‘Gina had once mentioned her adopted pet to Her Highness, the Queen, at tea, the Queen’s children were all quite amused and teased Her Majesty. The Queen did not seem to mind though, because the Queen believed both in the truthfulness and the innocence of young ‘Gina’s account.</p><p>‘Gina liked having a topic to share at tea. Each tea time visit she would present a new account of Queenie’s conduct. It was ’Gina’s one sure conversational gambit. ’Gina always felt comfortable that a new Queenie story would please and amuse. This week ‘Gina had been planning to tell the story of the mouse Queenie had caught and left in the library. It had so startled Beatrice, who was dusting shelving at the time, that Beatrice had screamed with fright. This had caused Lord Fauxami, who was reading in the library, as he did frequently when it was time for Beatrice to dust, to leap to his feet and scatter newspaper everywhere. Beatrice, in her fright, completely forgot to tug and pull her uniform back into coverage, and his Lordship had to help her - although he did not seem to be particularly good at it as often more rather than less of Beatrice became uncovered. ‘Gina had thought she could just leave his Lordship out of the story, but now that she could not talk about cats what would she talk about?</p><p>Tea was at four o’clock. Precisely at 10 minutes until the hour Mr. Goldthread appeared to escort ‘Gina, in her red dress, up five flights of stairs, down two long hallways, across one large ballroom, up one more flight, down one more hallway, and then down a small spiral staircase to the family’s quarters and the small room where they shared tea. Mr. Goldthread having placed her there in front of her chair (with the large booster cushion) by two minutes to four would stand back. ’Gina would wait in silence until one minute later the Queen’s children would appear, usually laughing, but occasionally snapping at each other. Always, though, they would be talking. Each would assemble in front of the various chaises and stools to which each had been assigned, and there they would lounge until at precisely four the Queen herself would appear. All the Queen’s children would briefly bow their heads, and ‘Gina would kneel until feeling the toe of Mr. Goldthread nudge her heel. Then she would stand up and Mr. Goldthread would pick her up and plop her on the top of the towering pillow that filled her chair.</p><p>On this Wednesday ‘Gina felt a tension - though she would not have known to call it that. Everyone was quiet when the tea was poured (three parts milk, one part tea, and two teaspoons of sugar for ‘Gina) except for a daughter of the Queen, just a little bit older than ‘Gina, who sighed and sniffled, and once moaned. Seeing ‘Gina’s concerned look, the second oldest of the Queen’s sons turned to ’Gina and said, “Don’t worry about old runny nose.” He shot a dismissive sneer at his little sister. “She thinks she has seen a ghost.”</p><p>The young girl, who had overheard, shouted defensively back, “I have not seen a ghost. I have heard one!”</p><p>“OOOoooooo.” Two of the Queen’s other sons, twins, moaned together, and then quit in laughter.</p><p>“That’s not what it sounds like at all, and you know it. It’s just a meowing!” and here, her eyes puffy and red, the girl let out a long sob while the twins moaned “Meooooooooooow” and laughed.</p><p>The oldest of the Queen’s sons was almost a man. He leaned in towards ‘Gina and said in an aside “Mietzie lost her cat, Chevalier, and she thinks he’s dead and haunting her. Really. Such caterwauling.” And a moment later reflecting on what he had said added, “Oh that’s rather good: caterwauling. I have to get that in to the conversation. Ask me ‘Gina what all the racket is about so I can use my pun.”</p><p>But ‘Gina was too shocked by the topic of conversation to comply. “We’re not supposed to talk about …” she paused, “them.”</p><p>“What them?” the Prince asked.</p><p>“Them. Unh, furry purry things.” ‘Gina evasively answered.</p><p>The Prince frowned, thinking, and then, solving the puzzle, said rather loudly: “Cats! Oh good one. Why aren’t we supposed to talk of cats?”</p><p>The damage had been done. At the word ’cat’ Mietzie began to howl in deep sobs. “Chevalier! Chevalier! Who killed you?” And in answer there came a very faint, very high pitched, “Meow” The adults were distracted by all the clamor, and they had not heard the faint meow. The Queen’s boys and girls were too busy laughing at their sister, and also did not hear it, but Mietzie had and she let out a new sobbing cry. ‘Gina, who had heard it too, was puzzled. ’Gina momentarily forgot herself. Her mouth fell open and she said clearly “A cat?”</p><p>The Queen, so severe with herself and her staff, rarely disciplined her children. Now, as was typical, she calmly sipped tea while observing this domestic spontaneity. The Queen looked at ’Gina in curiosity when ‘Gina said “A cat.” The Queen’s look was simultaneous with a bump from Mr. Goldthread’s knee on the back of ‘Gina’s chair. This bump caused ’Gina’s tea to slop into its saucer. When Gina looked up from balancing this tea sea far from her pretty red dress she saw the angry glare of Mietzie focused on her.</p><p>“You’re making fun of me!” Mietzie accused. In fact, ‘Gina was the only one in the room who was not mocking Mietzie. ’Gina opened and closed her mouth in surprise. How can one defend oneself against a claim of mocking someone’s dead cat ’Gina thought, when you cannot talk about cats, and you don’t think the cat is dead?</p><p>“Why does she have to be here Mother?” Mietzie asked the Queen. “She’s common, and now she is mocking me. She doesn’t care about me or Chevalier. Poor thing. Gone three days, and still haunting me. Chevalier!”</p><p>In response to Mietzie’s speech the boys laughed, and Mietzie’s sisters tittered behind their hands. The Queen looked at her daughter and frowned. Mr. Goldthread’s expression and gaze did not waver from straight ahead. The servants who poured the tea retired at the angry words as if they were a signal to dismiss. Amid this tumult ‘Gina again heard a faint, plaintive “meow.” Again, lost in concentration she said in her soft questioning voice, “A cat.” This made Mietzie wail louder, and Mr. Goldthread again bumped ‘Gina’s chair, harder. This time the bump was hard enough that the saucer could not contained the tea and a few drops slopped from the saucer onto ’Gina’s only pretty dress. ’Gina saw two small drops darken her treasured red satin. Then the drops had company as ’Gina’s tears followed to make their own dark impressions on the red satin.</p><p>Her family’s tea disturbed, the Queen looked about at her tittering, laughing children. The Queen frowned in puzzlement at the tearful ‘Gina. Then the Queen turned to the sobbing Mietzie, and allowed herself a very human sigh. “Oh Mietzie. What’s gotten into you?”</p><p>Mietzie, in grief and afraid, haunted by her dead cat, leaped up. Mietzie’s face red, she hastily turned to speak to the the Queen, her mother. Perhaps habit, or perhaps the immediate silence that her quick gesture had produced in her kin, made Mietzie pause. Then Mietzie reconsidered and turned slowly around to point at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Her. She’s what wrong. This common servant’s child is what is wrong with me. This little unappreciative snipe comes here to our table and mocks me, a princess!” The more Mietzie spoke the more relieved she felt. Thinking little of what she said, but only how good the catharsis felt, Mietzie let herself continue without reflection or consideration. “My poor cat has been dead three days, and she doesn’t care,” pointing at Gina. “She’s probably the one that killed it. That’s why Chevalier haunts me. He wants to reveal the criminal. Her!” Mietzie pointed a trembling finger at ‘Gina.</p><p>‘Gina shivered. More tea drops and tear drops stained her red dress. The Queen was distracted and dismayed by this outburst. The Queen had not realized the level of her daughter’s distress. The Queen had been preoccupied with matters of the state and of the household (that cousin of her’s, Fauxami). The Queen was about to speak and reassure Mietzie when she saw from the corner of her eye the slight motion of ‘Gina’s shivering. The Queen turned to look, and at the Queen’s movement everyone else followed her gaze. All the children, including Mietzie, fell silent watching their Royal Mother watch the little girl. Little ‘Gina quaked. Assuming fear the Queen readied herself to speak and reassure, but then the Queen paused. Something was not as it appeared, and the Queen decided, trained by years in charge, to wait until events became clearer.</p><p>Slowly ‘Gina’s shivering stopped. ’Gina raised her gaze from her spotted gown and stared directly into the eye’s of the accusing, grieving, and haunted Mietzie. ‘Gina looked very angry. All the children glanced at the Queen for reassurance when they saw ’Gina’s intense, cold stare. ‘Gina’s chair rocked onto two legs from the force of Mr. Goldthread’s thump. His gaze never wavered, but he saw without looking as talented men of his station were able to do. More tea slopped, and ‘Gina was impelled by the forward tilt of her chair to stand. Slowly ’Gina turned and handed her cup with its flooded saucer to Mr. Goldthread who received it without comment and without looking down.</p><p>Then ‘Gina turned slowly back to the party. The Queen’s expression was curious, and the expression of the eldest Prince held an impish smile, but for all others there was nothing but fear or, in Mietzie’s case, contempt.</p><p>‘Gina’s instructions for royal conversation had been few. Speak only when spoken to. Never dispute. Always defer. But she now disregarded this advice. She went to both knees and asked the Queen’s permission to speak freely to her Royal Highness the Princess Mary Miriam Marie, usually called Mietzie.</p><p>The Queen’s life was a difficult one, but it was also an ordered one. The Queen was rarely surprised. She was often bemused, but infrequently amused. The Queen’s life was predictable. There were always problems, and uncertainties, but there were likewise protocols. While the Queen did not always know what the results of her actions would be, she almost always knew what course her actions should follow. Mr.Goldthread, as her advisor, was the only voice that she allowed to dissent, but as his training had conformed to her’s even he rarely surprised with unexpected advice. In the last several years, the only true surprise the Queen had had had come from this little offended, insulted girl kneeling before her. The Queen was wary. She did not want to lose her time with this little, dear, novelty, but she could not permit a commoner to insult her Princess daughter. What should ’Gina do? What would little ‘Gina say if allowed to speak? If ‘Gina should say something, anything, inappropriate to the Princess Mietzie the Queen should have no choice but to banish ‘Gina from the upstairs. Cease contact. No more teas. No more childhood perspectives on her royal world. No more amusement. The Queen could see the animated activity on ‘Gina’s brow. ’Gina’s forehead creased in thought. ’Gina’s eyebrows knotted. Then the Queen saw ’Gina’s face relax, and the Queen, with hesitancy, regret, and a paradoxical enjoyment at her own complete ignorance of what would happen next assented. “Speak to the Princess Mietzie freely and … aware of her status, and yours.” the Queen added.</p><p>‘Gina seemed to have grown older while on her knees. She rose, and with head bowed, addressed the Queen politely. “Thank you your Highness. My station is clear.” Then, turning towards Mietzie, ’Gina raised her face and looking straight at the confused Princess (Why had Mother allowed this thing to speak to her freely? Mietzie thought. Mother was smart? Why would she do this?). Mietzie felt insecure, but the unease could not quench the sadness which had been transmuted to hurt and anger and that Mietzie had targeted for lack of any other option at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Princess. Did you breakfast in your chambers on the morning you lost your cat?” ‘Gina asked.</p><p>“I didn’t lose him. He died. You killed him. Or one of your people did.” And then glancing at the Queen and the Queen’s neutral expression Mietzie added, “No. I did not breakfast in my room.”</p><p>“Princess. Did you make your bed before leaving for breakfast?”</p><p>And here the rest of the Queen’s children could not suppress themselves. They all laughed. Even Mietzie had to smile. “No, ‘Gina. I did not make my bed.”</p><p>“Princess. When you returned from breakfast was your bed made?”</p><p>“Of course. There would have been consequences if it had not been. Maybe for your mother even.” And Mietzie’s smiled curled into a snarl.</p><p>“Princess. Did you see the servant that made your bed?”</p><p>“No. And I should not have. If you knew your place as well as the other servants I shouldn’t see you either.” Mietzie felt bad as she said this. Mietzie actually liked ‘Gina. ’Gina was almost her age, and ‘Gina seemed to like her cat stories about Chevalier. Mietzie did not like what she was saying to ‘Gina now, but for some reason she felt that royal rules of conduct demanded she finish what she started. Mietzie did not believe she should show any common person deference.</p><p>At this exchange ‘Gina walked directly towards Mietzie. Mietzie took a self-conscious step back, but ‘Gina passed beside her to go and stand at the bookshelf lined wall behind where Mietzie stood.</p><p>“It is fortunate for your Chevalier that I am a servant’s child, and that I know the place and ways of servants at least as well as you know Royal ones.” Taking the stool from beside a nearby chair, ‘Gina placed it near the book case. She stood upon it, turned and reached behind some books to grab a small handle that when she turned it clicked and revealed a small door that had been disguised by the book case. On revealing the door a louder “Meow” could be heard. As ’Gina opened the door to the hidden servants’ passage there ran out a fat Siamese cat. It raced to Mietzie who had fallen to her knees shouting “Chevalier.”</p><p>Mietzie’s brothers and sisters all raced to Mietzie and the cat. ‘Gina continued speaking: “You heard your cat trapped in the servant’s passage used to access your room when you are away. If you had known more of the servant’s ways, you could have saved your cat days ago, and without that knowledge it is you who would have killed your cat.” Then the royal family heard a click and a clack, and looked up from Mietzie’s reunion to find the room as it had been before except that ‘Gina was gone. ’Gina had left through the servants’ passage and closed the door behind her. The Queen’s offended gaze thought it detected a slight smile on the lips of Mr. Goldthread, but the Queen could not be sure. “Mr. Goldthread,” she scolded, “No one leaves the Queen’s company without being formally dismissed.’’ Then, looking down the Queen was met by the puzzled joy on Mietzie’s face. The Queen felt it echoed her own surprise. The Queen broke into a smile at Mietzie’s delight while she hugged her cat. Mietzie buried her face in Chevalier’s fur. The Queen added to her speech to Mr. Goldthread. “And make sure ’Gina knows that for next month.”</p></root><a href="chapter1.html">Prior Chapter Her Highness</a><p><a href="chapter3.html">Next Chapter Apologia</a></p></body></html>
