Thepreceding Monday preparations began. Mr. Goldthread would predictablyappear and with his unique combination of amusement and severityinstruct the little girl as to acceptable and unacceptable topics ofconversation. These varied depending both on affairs of state andhousehold gossip. Thus, the little girl was informed about politics atlarge and local - perhaps more informed than those instructing herperceived. This week ’Gina, for they now all, both upstairs anddownstairs, called her by this nickname: the diminutive for Regina;found Mr. Goldthread looking at her with an expression that when shelooked at him with both eyes seemed a scold, but when she squinted athim with just one eye seemed a smile. Mr. Goldthread told ‘Gina thatthis week, under no circumstance, was she to 1) inquire after LordFauxami, 2) request information on the Maldives, or 3) speak of cats.</p><p>The first two of the three did not present any problems, but foropposite reasons. As to the Maldives she was completely ignorant, exceptthat she knew it was a place. She had been provided with a very goodatlas, and later she would locate the Maldives on it. As to LordFauxami, she was completely informed about occurrences. The staff<b>telegraph</b> was quite efficient. Regina knew from sources that LordFauxami had left the household in the company of Beatrice fromhousekeeping. ‘Gina always thought Beatrice silly and funny. This wasbecause Beatrice never seemed to be able to find a uniform that fit herproperly. Even when she was provided with a new uniform, a uniform thatfit perfectly, ’Gina noticed that within a day or two, due to Beatrice’sbad luck, the uniform would have shrunk or been otherwise altered tosuch an extent that Beatrice was always forced to pull and tug to keepthe odd corners of herself covered. Unfortunately, the tug that hid onebit of skin always revealed another elsewhere, and so it was thatBeatrice never managed to stay completely modest. Beatrice’s work wasalways accompanied by a swishing, twitching mannerism that led to nearcalamity whenever she was required to dust the upper shelving - aresponsibility from which , to her credit, she never shirked. In fact itwas a responsibility for which she often volunteered.</p><p>In contrast to Beatrice’s apparel misfortunes, his Lordship Fauxami, ahandsome man, was always finely dressed. ‘Gina had seen him severaltimes through the valet spy holes. When she made rounds with the headbutler it was not uncommon to come upon a group of young maids clusteredabout one of these peepholes. And while the head butler shooed them backto work, ’Gina took the opportunity to see what it was they had all beenwatching. Often it was the handsome figure of his Lordship Fauxami.’Gina could also tell whether Beatrice was likewise in the room. If so,the finely dressed Lord would appear distressed. ’Gina felt sorry forhim. Whenever Beatrice entered a room to clean his Lordship would beginto cross and uncross his legs rapidly while leafing quickly through thebook or newspaper he was reading. It little surprised ‘Gina that someoneas nice as his Lordship (he had patted her on the head once when she wascoming back from tea) would be concerned with Beatrice’s poor fittingclothes. It also did not surprise ’Gina when she learned that thegenerous Fauxami had decided to take Beatrice under his wing and outfither properly. As ‘Gina thought about this she lightly stroked the clothand pleats of her own dress and felt in her imagination the lightslickness of the satin which she would be allowed to wear on Wednesdayfor tea. She saw in her mind’s eye the red dress being removed from itsspecial closet on the floor above the one where she slept with hermother.</p><p>But now ‘Gina bit her lower lip: cats! How could she not talk aboutcats? Cats was about the only topic she had in common with the royalfamily. ‘Gina had a cat, or rather there was a cat that came daily tosee ‘Gina for the scraps she fed it from the pantry. Each day in themid-afternoon the cat appeared near the pantry door hissing at anyonewho was not ‘Gina. Perhaps this was because whenever the cat appearedthere and ‘Gina was not around the cat’s greeting consisted of a swatwith a broom and a loud shout of “Shoo! Scat!” The cat therefore hadbecome choosy, and would sit high up on a rafter watching for ‘Gina’sapproach. At which approach the cat would jump down and walk zig zagbetween ‘Gina’s legs guiding her to the pantry where ‘Gina alwaysmanaged to use her favored status to procure some small scrap for thecat.</p><p>‘Gina called the cat “Queenie” because tufts of fur around the cat’sears looked to ‘Gina like a little crown. When ‘Gina had once mentionedher adopted pet to Her Highness, the Queen, at tea, the Queen’s childrenwere all quite amused and teased Her Majesty. The Queen did not seem tomind though, because the Queen believed both in the truthfulness and theinnocence of young ‘Gina’s account.</p><p>‘Gina liked having a topic to share at tea. Each tea time visit shewould present a new account of Queenie’s conduct. It was ’Gina’s onesure conversational gambit. ’Gina always felt comfortable that a newQueenie story would please and amuse. This week ‘Gina had been planningto tell the story of the mouse Queenie had caught and left in thelibrary. It had so startled Beatrice, who was dusting shelving at thetime, that Beatrice had screamed with fright. This had caused LordFauxami, who was reading in the library, as he did frequently when itwas time for Beatrice to dust, to leap to his feet and scatter newspapereverywhere. Beatrice, in her fright, completely forgot to tug and pullher uniform back into coverage, and his Lordship had to help her -although he did not seem to be particularly good at it as often morerather than less of Beatrice became uncovered. ‘Gina had thought shecould just leave his Lordship out of the story, but now that she couldnot talk about cats what would she talk about?</p><p>Tea was at four o’clock. Precisely at 10 minutes until the hour Mr.Goldthread appeared to escort ‘Gina, in her red dress, up five flightsof stairs, down two long hallways, across one large ballroom, up onemore flight, down one more hallway, and then down a small spiralstaircase to the family’s quarters and the small room where they sharedtea. Mr. Goldthread having placed her there in front of her chair (withthe large booster cushion) by two minutes to four would stand back.’Gina would wait in silence until one minute later the Queen’s childrenwould appear, usually laughing, but occasionally snapping at each other.Always, though, they would be talking. Each would assemble in front ofthe various chaises and stools to which each had been assigned, andthere they would lounge until at precisely four the Queen herself wouldappear. All the Queen’s children would briefly bow their heads, and‘Gina would kneel until feeling the toe of Mr. Goldthread nudge herheel. Then she would stand up and Mr. Goldthread would pick her up andplop her on the top of the towering pillow that filled her chair.</p><p>On this Wednesday ‘Gina felt a tension - though she would not have knownto call it that. Everyone was quiet when the tea was poured (three partsmilk, one part tea, and two teaspoons of sugar for ‘Gina) except for adaughter of the Queen, just a little bit older than ‘Gina, who sighedand sniffled, and once moaned. Seeing ‘Gina’s concerned look, the secondoldest of the Queen’s sons turned to ’Gina and said, “Don’t worry aboutold runny nose.” He shot a dismissive sneer at his little sister. “Shethinks she has seen a ghost.”</p><p>The young girl, who had overheard, shouted defensively back, “I have notseen a ghost. I have heard one!”</p><p>“OOOoooooo.” Two of the Queen’s other sons, twins, moaned together, andthen quit in laughter.</p><p>“That’s not what it sounds like at all, and you know it. It’s just ameowing!” and here, her eyes puffy and red, the girl let out a long sobwhile the twins moaned “Meooooooooooow” and laughed.</p><p>The oldest of the Queen’s sons was almost a man. He leaned in towards‘Gina and said in an aside “Mietzie lost her cat, Chevalier, and shethinks he’s dead and haunting her. Really. Such caterwauling.” And amoment later reflecting on what he had said added, “Oh that’s rathergood: caterwauling. I have to get that in to the conversation. Ask me‘Gina what all the racket is about so I can use my pun.”</p><p>But ‘Gina was too shocked by the topic of conversation to comply. “We’renot supposed to talk about …” she paused, “them.”</p><p>“What them?” the Prince asked.</p><p>“Them. Unh, furry purry things.” ‘Gina evasively answered.</p><p>The Prince frowned, thinking, and then, solving the puzzle, said ratherloudly: “Cats! Oh good one. Why aren’t we supposed to talk of cats?”</p><p>The damage had been done. At the word ’cat’ Mietzie began to howl indeep sobs. “Chevalier! Chevalier! Who killed you?” And in answer therecame a very faint, very high pitched, “Meow” The adults were distractedby all the clamor, and they had not heard the faint meow. The Queen’sboys and girls were too busy laughing at their sister, and also did nothear it, but Mietzie had and she let out a new sobbing cry. ‘Gina, whohad heard it too, was puzzled. ’Gina momentarily forgot herself. Hermouth fell open and she said clearly “A cat?”</p><p>The Queen, so severe with herself and her staff, rarely disciplined herchildren. Now, as was typical, she calmly sipped tea while observingthis domestic spontaneity. The Queen looked at ’Gina in curiosity when‘Gina said “A cat.” The Queen’s look was simultaneous with a bump fromMr. Goldthread’s knee on the back of ‘Gina’s chair. This bump caused’Gina’s tea to slop into its saucer. When Gina looked up from balancingthis tea sea far from her pretty red dress she saw the angry glare ofMietzie focused on her.</p><p>“You’re making fun of me!” Mietzie accused. In fact, ‘Gina was the onlyone in the room who was not mocking Mietzie. ’Gina opened and closed hermouth in surprise. How can one defend oneself against a claim of mockingsomeone’s dead cat ’Gina thought, when you cannot talk about cats, andyou don’t think the cat is dead?</p><p>“Why does she have to be here Mother?” Mietzie asked the Queen. “She’scommon, and now she is mocking me. She doesn’t care about me orChevalier. Poor thing. Gone three days, and still haunting me.Chevalier!”</p><p>In response to Mietzie’s speech the boys laughed, and Mietzie’s sisterstittered behind their hands. The Queen looked at her daughter andfrowned. Mr. Goldthread’s expression and gaze did not waver fromstraight ahead. The servants who poured the tea retired at the angrywords as if they were a signal to dismiss. Amid this tumult ‘Gina againheard a faint, plaintive “meow.” Again, lost in concentration she saidin her soft questioning voice, “A cat.” This made Mietzie wail louder,and Mr. Goldthread again bumped ‘Gina’s chair, harder. This time thebump was hard enough that the saucer could not contained the tea and afew drops slopped from the saucer onto ’Gina’s only pretty dress. ’Ginasaw two small drops darken her treasured red satin. Then the drops hadcompany as ’Gina’s tears followed to make their own dark impressions onthe red satin.</p><p>Her family’s tea disturbed, the Queen looked about at her tittering,laughing children. The Queen frowned in puzzlement at the tearful ‘Gina.Then the Queen turned to the sobbing Mietzie, and allowed herself a veryhuman sigh. “Oh Mietzie. What’s gotten into you?”</p><p>Mietzie, in grief and afraid, haunted by her dead cat, leaped up.Mietzie’s face red, she hastily turned to speak to the the Queen, hermother. Perhaps habit, or perhaps the immediate silence that her quickgesture had produced in her kin, made Mietzie pause. Then Mietziereconsidered and turned slowly around to point at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Her. She’s what wrong. This common servant’s child is what is wrongwith me. This little unappreciative snipe comes here to our table andmocks me, a princess!” The more Mietzie spoke the more relieved shefelt. Thinking little of what she said, but only how good the catharsisfelt, Mietzie let herself continue without reflection or consideration.“My poor cat has been dead three days, and she doesn’t care,” pointingat Gina. “She’s probably the one that killed it. That’s why Chevalierhaunts me. He wants to reveal the criminal. Her!” Mietzie pointed atrembling finger at ‘Gina.</p><p>‘Gina shivered. More tea drops and tear drops stained her red dress. TheQueen was distracted and dismayed by this outburst. The Queen had notrealized the level of her daughter’s distress. The Queen had beenpreoccupied with matters of the state and of the household (that cousinof her’s, Fauxami). The Queen was about to speak and reassure Mietziewhen she saw from the corner of her eye the slight motion of ‘Gina’sshivering. The Queen turned to look, and at the Queen’s movementeveryone else followed her gaze. All the children, including Mietzie,fell silent watching their Royal Mother watch the little girl. Little‘Gina quaked. Assuming fear the Queen readied herself to speak andreassure, but then the Queen paused. Something was not as it appeared,and the Queen decided, trained by years in charge, to wait until eventsbecame clearer.</p><p>Slowly ‘Gina’s shivering stopped. ’Gina raised her gaze from her spottedgown and stared directly into the eye’s of the accusing, grieving, andhaunted Mietzie. ‘Gina looked very angry. All the children glanced atthe Queen for reassurance when they saw ’Gina’s intense, cold stare.‘Gina’s chair rocked onto two legs from the force of Mr. Goldthread’sthump. His gaze never wavered, but he saw without looking as talentedmen of his station were able to do. More tea slopped, and ‘Gina wasimpelled by the forward tilt of her chair to stand. Slowly ’Gina turnedand handed her cup with its flooded saucer to Mr. Goldthread whoreceived it without comment and without looking down.</p><p>Then ‘Gina turned slowly back to the party. The Queen’s expression wascurious, and the expression of the eldest Prince held an impish smile,but for all others there was nothing but fear or, in Mietzie’s case,contempt.</p><p>‘Gina’s instructions for royal conversation had been few. Speak onlywhen spoken to. Never dispute. Always defer. But she now disregardedthis advice. She went to both knees and asked the Queen’s permission tospeak freely to her Royal Highness the Princess Mary Miriam Marie,usually called Mietzie.</p><p>The Queen’s life was a difficult one, but it was also an ordered one.The Queen was rarely surprised. She was often bemused, but infrequentlyamused. The Queen’s life was predictable. There were always problems,and uncertainties, but there were likewise protocols. While the Queendid not always know what the results of her actions would be, she almostalways knew what course her actions should follow. Mr.Goldthread, as heradvisor, was the only voice that she allowed to dissent, but as histraining had conformed to her’s even he rarely surprised with unexpectedadvice. In the last several years, the only true surprise the Queen hadhad had come from this little offended, insulted girl kneeling beforeher. The Queen was wary. She did not want to lose her time with thislittle, dear, novelty, but she could not permit a commoner to insult herPrincess daughter. What should ’Gina do? What would little ‘Gina say ifallowed to speak? If ‘Gina should say something, anything, inappropriateto the Princess Mietzie the Queen should have no choice but to banish‘Gina from the upstairs. Cease contact. No more teas. No more childhoodperspectives on her royal world. No more amusement. The Queen could seethe animated activity on ‘Gina’s brow. ’Gina’s forehead creased inthought. ’Gina’s eyebrows knotted. Then the Queen saw ’Gina’s facerelax, and the Queen, with hesitancy, regret, and a paradoxicalenjoyment at her own complete ignorance of what would happen nextassented. “Speak to the Princess Mietzie freely and … aware of herstatus, and yours.” the Queen added.</p><p>‘Gina seemed to have grown older while on her knees. She rose, and withhead bowed, addressed the Queen politely. “Thank you your Highness. Mystation is clear.” Then, turning towards Mietzie, ’Gina raised her faceand looking straight at the confused Princess (Why had Mother allowedthis thing to speak to her freely? Mietzie thought. Mother was smart?Why would she do this?). Mietzie felt insecure, but the unease could notquench the sadness which had been transmuted to hurt and anger and thatMietzie had targeted for lack of any other option at ‘Gina.</p><p>“Princess. Did you breakfast in your chambers on the morning you lostyour cat?” ‘Gina asked.</p><p>“I didn’t lose him. He died. You killed him. Or one of your people did.”And then glancing at the Queen and the Queen’s neutral expressionMietzie added, “No. I did not breakfast in my room.”</p><p>“Princess. Did you make your bed before leaving for breakfast?”</p><p>And here the rest of the Queen’s children could not suppress themselves.They all laughed. Even Mietzie had to smile. “No, ‘Gina. I did not makemy bed.”</p><p>“Princess. When you returned from breakfast was your bed made?”</p><p>“Of course. There would have been consequences if it had not been. Maybefor your mother even.” And Mietzie’s smiled curled into a snarl.</p><p>“Princess. Did you see the servant that made your bed?”</p><p>“No. And I should not have. If you knew your place as well as the otherservants I shouldn’t see you either.” Mietzie felt bad as she said this.Mietzie actually liked ‘Gina. ’Gina was almost her age, and ‘Gina seemedto like her cat stories about Chevalier. Mietzie did not like what shewas saying to ‘Gina now, but for some reason she felt that royal rulesof conduct demanded she finish what she started. Mietzie did not believeshe should show any common person deference.</p><p>At this exchange ‘Gina walked directly towards Mietzie. Mietzie took aself-conscious step back, but ‘Gina passed beside her to go and stand atthe bookshelf lined wall behind where Mietzie stood.</p><p>“It is fortunate for your Chevalier that I am a servant’s child, andthat I know the place and ways of servants at least as well as you knowRoyal ones.” Taking the stool from beside a nearby chair, ‘Gina placedit near the book case. She stood upon it, turned and reached behind somebooks to grab a small handle that when she turned it clicked andrevealed a small door that had been disguised by the book case. Onrevealing the door a louder “Meow” could be heard. As ’Gina opened thedoor to the hidden servants’ passage there ran out a fat Siamese cat. Itraced to Mietzie who had fallen to her knees shouting “Chevalier.”</p><p>Mietzie’s brothers and sisters all raced to Mietzie and the cat. ‘Ginacontinued speaking: “You heard your cat trapped in the servant’s passageused to access your room when you are away. If you had known more of theservant’s ways, you could have saved your cat days ago, and without thatknowledge it is you who would have killed your cat.” Then the royalfamily heard a click and a clack, and looked up from Mietzie’s reunionto find the room as it had been before except that ‘Gina was gone. ’Ginahad left through the servants’ passage and closed the door behind her.The Queen’s offended gaze thought it detected a slight smile on the lipsof Mr. Goldthread, but the Queen could not be sure. “Mr. Goldthread,”she scolded, “No one leaves the Queen’s company without being formallydismissed.’’ Then, looking down the Queen was met by the puzzled joy onMietzie’s face. The Queen felt it echoed her own surprise. The Queenbroke into a smile at Mietzie’s delight while she hugged her cat.Mietzie buried her face in Chevalier’s fur. The Queen added to herspeech to Mr. Goldthread. “And make sure ’Gina knows that for nextmonth.”</p></root><a href="chapter1.html">Prior Chapter Her Highness</a><p><a href="chapter3.html">Next Chapter Apologia</a></p></body></html>
