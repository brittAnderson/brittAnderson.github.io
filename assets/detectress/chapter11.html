Regina and hermother had never been separated from each other for a single night intheir entire lives. In fact, they had shared a single bed for almost allof it. While Mr. Goldthread respected them both, he was truly unsurewhat should happen when it came time for Regina to leave. Mother anddaughter nodded to the men, and then locked themselves in their smallshared room.</p><p>Herr Stoll gave a questioning shrug to which Mr. Goldthread said, “Aslong as they wish.”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread and the Queen’s Guards heard nothing aside from a fewfaint rustlings. For 15 minutes Herr Gafner, Herr Stoll, and Mr.Goldthread waited patiently outside. When the door opened the three mensaw two calm, stoic, and very wet faces.</p><p>“Remember Mother. When they tell you the letters say I am asking aftermy Nurse, it really means you,” Regina said.</p><p>“I just wish I could write you back, but Mr. Goldthread says I ought’nand he’s probably right. But I will be thinking of you every moment. Hesays he will get a message to you if needs be.”</p><p>“Indeed I will Madam.” Mr. Goldthread reassured.</p><p>“Well…” was all Regina could say before she buried her face in hermother’s bosom and squeezed her hard with a hug. Her mother kissed thetop of Regina’s head, and without a sign they separated as one,straightened, and with the same simple gesture each used two hands tosmooth back her hair. Regina pivoted. She looked directly at Mr.Goldthread and said. “I am ready, Sir.”</p><p>Without further spoken commands the three men turned and proceeded tothe stairs that would take them out of the servants’ quarters. Reginafollowed without turning around. Regina’s mother stood stiffly watchingthe quartet depart. After they had disappeared around the cornerRegina’s mother became aware of an unusual quiet. She turned to see theQueen standing silently behind her. Beyond the Queen was bowing staff.Regina’s mother too begin to bow, but before she had moved very far shefelt the Queen’s hand on her shoulder and heard her clearly say, “No.Not today.”The Queen’s hand began to gently stroke Regina’s mother’sshoulder. “Are you certain you will not let me arrange a small vacationfor you at one of my estates? It seems unfair to keep you toiling herewhile your daughter undertakes this mission for me.”</p><p>“No Your Highness. I want to be here where I know her letters will becoming. It makes me feel closer knowin’ they can reach me if there needsbe. Even just knowing that I’ll be near where the people who will bereading her words are will help. And the work will distract me.”</p><p>“As you wish. But there is no ceremony where Regina is concerned. If youneed to reach me with questions or concerns about your daughter you godirectly to Mr. Goldthread. No need for intermediate staff.”</p><p>“Yes M’am.” Regina’s mother bowed her head. The Queen regarded the bravewoman in front of her and idly wondered how she, the Queen, would haveresponded to such a task if she had not been bred to it? She idlystroked Regina’s mother shoulder for a moment longer. This was aninteresting, strong woman. How many more like her, the Queen wondered,were down here wasting their time polishing, sweeping, and washing whentheir characters potentially made them capable of so much more? This wasa conversation worth having. “I would like to talk to you further mydear, when this is over. We shall have tea together.”</p><p>Regina’s mother could only gape, and with a final pat on Regina’smother’s shoulder, the Queen moved to follow the path out of theservants area.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Regina had seen carriages come and go from the great house, but she hadnever been in one. This carriage was black, plain, and slightly seedy.Sitting on the driver’s bench was an unshaven older man in a greasestained duster. He winked at Regina as she approached, and exchanged afew words with Herr Gafner in the dialect they spoke. As Regina climbedin, she stood and looked about. Mr. Goldthread spoke: “Sit facingforward. Less likely to get sick that way. Remember, keep your veil downand the curtains drawn on this leg. It will be several hours drivebefore the switch. Sleep if you can, though I doubt that you will.”</p><p>And he was right about that. Regina had seen numerous carriages come andgo from the great house. From various hidden, secret perches she hadwatched elegance arrive and depart. But not once had Regina ever evenbeen next to a carriage, let alone in one. She felt the carriage sink abit with the weight of her trunk being slung onto the back. She satfacing forward as instructed. Her hands rested in her lap. When thecurtains were pulled aside she saw Mr. Goldthread’s face, and to hersurprise it was split with a broad smile. “ Well Miss Kaiserkönig, anylast questions?” Regina shook her head. “You know, I truly believe youwill be exceptional at this. I truly do.” Then he dropped the curtain inplace, and Regina heard a crack of a whip and felt the carriage lurch.And though she had regarded it as an impossibility, Regina felt herselfgrow sleepy within just a few moments of the carriage’s gentle rockingin the dark. It was the memory of her mother’s lips upon her head thatguided Regina in to a deep and dreamless sleep.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Regina awoke with the realization that the carriage had stopped moving.Regina sat up. Her face felt puffy. It was creased from where she hadlain on it. A couple of hand slaps on her door alerted her that shecould open it, which she did after a moment to straighten her hair.Regina could see daylight slicing in at the edges of the carriage’scurtains. She felt the carriage shift again, and guessed her trunk wasbeing removed.</p><p>On opening the door Regina saw Herr Gafner and Herr Stoll in livery. Theformer inspected two beautiful dappled geldings that were bridled to asecond white carriage bearing the coat of arms of the Kaiserkönig line.Herr Stoll belted her trunk on to the back of the new carriage. Seeingher emerge, he spoke, “There is a dress in there,” he gestured to awooden stable building. “Please change. We would leave as soon aspossible.” Regina looked up at the slightly seedy driver of the blackcarriage. He tipped his hat and winked again. “Auf widerlüge“ heshouted. Without waiting for replies, he cracked his whip and the blackcarriage raced off. Regina did as she was told, and went off to change.</p><p>Regina had wanted to watch the countryside, a vision she had never seenin her short life. All her years had been spent as a child of one of theQueen’s household staff and she had never once, that she could remember,been off the royal grounds. But as the landscape slid by Regina began tobecome queasy. Not wanting to begin her time at the school compromisedshe pulled the curtains shut, and opened and closed the book she held onher lap never reading any of it. Regina was constantly rehearsing in hermind her what she was to do on arriving, who she would meet, who wasrelated to whom, and then, still being a young girl, wondering if peoplewould like her, and how long it would take them to figure out she was astupid servant.</p><p>Regina felt embarrassed by the prospect, but her dominant feeling wasanger at thinking that if so she would be letting down the Queen. Thisanger helped to banish the embarrassment, and to focus Regina on hertask. Replaying the genealogy of the various royal houses helped Reginato focus and she soon lost her motion sickness. Regina was actuallysurprised when she felt the cadence of the carriage change. Then sheheard the rumble of their rutted dirt track change to the clack ofcobblestones beneath their wheels. They were in the town.</p><p>Oh how Regina wanted to open the curtains, and stick her head outside togaze at the city and compare it to her dreams and Mietze’s stories.Regina imagined though that her alter-ego Janus would be more sanguineabout cities, and that it would not help her disguise to appear too muchthe rustic. It seemed safer to simply contain herself inside the closedcarriage.</p><p>Regina heard the clatter of footsteps alongside. Shouts. Children. Somebegging, and some cheering. Apparently carriages from the Kaiserkönigline attracted attention. The voices faded, and there was a knock on thewall behind her. The sign. They would be entering school soon, theSchool for Aristocrats and Diplomats (SAD) at Le Grande Ecole Camford.Now Regina pulled back the curtains, and then leaned back in a ratherpoor imitation of boredom. She saw high buildings to either side. Somewere wood, but most were made of stone. Some of the windows heldon-lookers. Others were empty, and a few aired out laundry for drying.Then abruptly the buildings disappeared as they went through a stonearch. Regina found herself entering a broad square courtyard with acentral lawn and buildings on all sides. She could see a small coteriegathered ahead, and the coach came to a slow stop before them. HerrStoll leaped from his place behind to open the door and placed a smallfootstool before Regina as a step. Regina arose slowly and came downcarefully, fearful of marking her entrance by tripping on her exit. Shemade certain to look neither at Herr Gafner or Herr Stoll.</p><p>Comfortably on solid ground Regina scrutinized the three people beforeher. One was clearly a servant. He immediately moved to join Herr Stollbehind the carriage, presumably to help with Regina’s trunk. The secondwas probably another student. She seemed about Regina’s age. For thethird she did not have to guess. This woman stepped forward and bowedher head briefly. “Greetings. Viscountess Janus. I am Athena Bostick.Head Mistress.”</p><p>The Head Mistress extended her hand. Regina stared straight into theHead Mistress’s eyes, and removed one glove before taking the HeadMistress’s hand in her own. Miss Bostick held it firmly and Regina feltfinger tips probe and palpate. Finally, Miss Bostick released her. “Youmust be quite the athlete Viscountess. We have many opportunities forsport.” Regina did not know why, but Miss Bostick alarmed her. Reginaslid her glove back on quickly. Before she could reply the other studentcame forward, and enthusiastically grabbed the gloved hand and pumpedit.</p><p>“Hello Viscountess. I am so happy you’re here. All the kids have beentalking about it. We never thought there would be a Kaiserkönig here.What did you do?”</p><p>“Miss Andalonia!” the Head Mistress barked. “Please. Some decorum.”</p><p>Regina saw the girl’s eyes tear up, and felt her begin to pull back, butRegina held on, and looking at the Head Mistress spoke to the girl.“What a pleasure to make your acquaintance Miss Andalonia.”</p><p>The girl looked with confusion between Regina and the Head Mistress, andthen managed to wiggle her hands out of Regina’s grip. “Sorry HeadMistress. I was just so excited to meet her. She will be my firstmentee.”</p><p>“Yes. Well one’s anticipation doesn’t excuse assault. We have discussedthis Helene.”</p><p>“Yes Head Mistress.”</p><p>Turning to Regina, the distracted Head Mistress said: “Viscountess JanusKaiserkönig, may I present to you Miss Helene Andalonia, daughter of thePyrenean Ambassador. She is to be your student guide if that isacceptable?” The Head Mistress paused. “We call the guide a mentor andnew student a mentee.”</p><p>“Did you say Miss Andalonia was a menteur Head Mistress? That hardlyseems polite.” Regina asked this in a sarcastic tone. This cheek seemedappropriate to her role, and it came easily since she already dislikedand was suspicious of the Head Mistress. Something in the way the womanhad probed her hand. Regina heard Helene giggle.</p><p>“Non. Je dit un mot Anglais: mentor.”</p><p>“Quelle domage,” replied Regina, “The former would have been so muchmore diverting.” Even this bit of pretend patter tired Regina. She washaving to attend to so many things at once, and with a great and unusualintensity. Regina felt it wise to end the encounter. “Perhaps, I mightbe shown to my rooms Miss Bostick.”</p><p>“Yes, of course.” Miss Bostick flipped her hand and the servant with thetrunk began to move up the stairs. “Helene,” Regina asked “would you beso kind as to show me to my quarters.”</p><p>“Oh yes of course!”</p><p>Regina laced her arm in Helene’s and began to move up the stairs afterthe servant. Without looking back at the Head Mistress Regina lifted herother arm and dismissed the carriage with an exact replica of MissBostick’s own hand flipping gesture. It was a true tribute to therigorous discipline and training of the Swiss Guards that Herrn Gafnerand Stoll were able to avoid erupting in guffaws. Hoping their slightsmiles passed as grimaces Gafner and Stoll looked away as the carriagepulled through the gate, and as Regina disappeared into the schoolbuilding.</p></root><a href="chapter10.html">Prior Chapter Preparations</a><p><a href="chapter12.html">Next Chapter Flight of the Bumblebee</a></p></body></html>
