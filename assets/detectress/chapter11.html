Regina and her<br/>mother had never been separated from each other for a single night in<br/>their entire lives. In fact, they had shared a single bed for almost all<br/>of it. While Mr. Goldthread respected them both, he was truly unsure<br/>what should happen when it came time for Regina to leave. Mother and<br/>daughter nodded to the men, and then locked themselves in their small<br/>shared room.</p><p>Herr Stoll gave a questioning shrug to which Mr. Goldthread said, “As<br/>long as they wish.”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread and the Queen’s Guards heard nothing aside from a few<br/>faint rustlings. For 15 minutes Herr Gafner, Herr Stoll, and Mr.<br/>Goldthread waited patiently outside. When the door opened the three men<br/>saw two calm, stoic, and very wet faces.</p><p>“Remember Mother. When they tell you the letters say I am asking after<br/>my Nurse, it really means you,” Regina said.</p><p>“I just wish I could write you back, but Mr. Goldthread says I ought’n<br/>and he’s probably right. But I will be thinking of you every moment. He<br/>says he will get a message to you if needs be.”</p><p>“Indeed I will Madam.” Mr. Goldthread reassured.</p><p>“Well…” was all Regina could say before she buried her face in her<br/>mother’s bosom and squeezed her hard with a hug. Her mother kissed the<br/>top of Regina’s head, and without a sign they separated as one,<br/>straightened, and with the same simple gesture each used two hands to<br/>smooth back her hair. Regina pivoted. She looked directly at Mr.<br/>Goldthread and said. “I am ready, Sir.”</p><p>Without further spoken commands the three men turned and proceeded to<br/>the stairs that would take them out of the servants’ quarters. Regina<br/>followed without turning around. Regina’s mother stood stiffly watching<br/>the quartet depart. After they had disappeared around the corner<br/>Regina’s mother became aware of an unusual quiet. She turned to see the<br/>Queen standing silently behind her. Beyond the Queen was bowing staff.<br/>Regina’s mother too begin to bow, but before she had moved very far she<br/>felt the Queen’s hand on her shoulder and heard her clearly say, “No.<br/>Not today.”The Queen’s hand began to gently stroke Regina’s mother’s<br/>shoulder. “Are you certain you will not let me arrange a small vacation<br/>for you at one of my estates? It seems unfair to keep you toiling here<br/>while your daughter undertakes this mission for me.”</p><p>“No Your Highness. I want to be here where I know her letters will be<br/>coming. It makes me feel closer knowin’ they can reach me if there needs<br/>be. Even just knowing that I’ll be near where the people who will be<br/>reading her words are will help. And the work will distract me.”</p><p>“As you wish. But there is no ceremony where Regina is concerned. If you<br/>need to reach me with questions or concerns about your daughter you go<br/>directly to Mr. Goldthread. No need for intermediate staff.”</p><p>“Yes M’am.” Regina’s mother bowed her head. The Queen regarded the brave<br/>woman in front of her and idly wondered how she, the Queen, would have<br/>responded to such a task if she had not been bred to it? She idly<br/>stroked Regina’s mother shoulder for a moment longer. This was an<br/>interesting, strong woman. How many more like her, the Queen wondered,<br/>were down here wasting their time polishing, sweeping, and washing when<br/>their characters potentially made them capable of so much more? This was<br/>a conversation worth having. “I would like to talk to you further my<br/>dear, when this is over. We shall have tea together.”</p><p>Regina’s mother could only gape, and with a final pat on Regina’s<br/>mother’s shoulder, the Queen moved to follow the path out of the<br/>servants area.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Regina had seen carriages come and go from the great house, but she had<br/>never been in one. This carriage was black, plain, and slightly seedy.<br/>Sitting on the driver’s bench was an unshaven older man in a grease<br/>stained duster. He winked at Regina as she approached, and exchanged a<br/>few words with Herr Gafner in the dialect they spoke. As Regina climbed<br/>in, she stood and looked about. Mr. Goldthread spoke: “Sit facing<br/>forward. Less likely to get sick that way. Remember, keep your veil down<br/>and the curtains drawn on this leg. It will be several hours drive<br/>before the switch. Sleep if you can, though I doubt that you will.”</p><p>And he was right about that. Regina had seen numerous carriages come and<br/>go from the great house. From various hidden, secret perches she had<br/>watched elegance arrive and depart. But not once had Regina ever even<br/>been next to a carriage, let alone in one. She felt the carriage sink a<br/>bit with the weight of her trunk being slung onto the back. She sat<br/>facing forward as instructed. Her hands rested in her lap. When the<br/>curtains were pulled aside she saw Mr. Goldthread’s face, and to her<br/>surprise it was split with a broad smile. “ Well Miss Kaiserkönig, any<br/>last questions?” Regina shook her head. “You know, I truly believe you<br/>will be exceptional at this. I truly do.” Then he dropped the curtain in<br/>place, and Regina heard a crack of a whip and felt the carriage lurch.<br/>And though she had regarded it as an impossibility, Regina felt herself<br/>grow sleepy within just a few moments of the carriage’s gentle rocking<br/>in the dark. It was the memory of her mother’s lips upon her head that<br/>guided Regina in to a deep and dreamless sleep.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Regina awoke with the realization that the carriage had stopped moving.<br/>Regina sat up. Her face felt puffy. It was creased from where she had<br/>lain on it. A couple of hand slaps on her door alerted her that she<br/>could open it, which she did after a moment to straighten her hair.<br/>Regina could see daylight slicing in at the edges of the carriage’s<br/>curtains. She felt the carriage shift again, and guessed her trunk was<br/>being removed.</p><p>On opening the door Regina saw Herr Gafner and Herr Stoll in livery. The<br/>former inspected two beautiful dappled geldings that were bridled to a<br/>second white carriage bearing the coat of arms of the Kaiserkönig line.<br/>Herr Stoll belted her trunk on to the back of the new carriage. Seeing<br/>her emerge, he spoke, “There is a dress in there,” he gestured to a<br/>wooden stable building. “Please change. We would leave as soon as<br/>possible.” Regina looked up at the slightly seedy driver of the black<br/>carriage. He tipped his hat and winked again. “Auf widerlüge“ he<br/>shouted. Without waiting for replies, he cracked his whip and the black<br/>carriage raced off. Regina did as she was told, and went off to change.</p><p>Regina had wanted to watch the countryside, a vision she had never seen<br/>in her short life. All her years had been spent as a child of one of the<br/>Queen’s household staff and she had never once, that she could remember,<br/>been off the royal grounds. But as the landscape slid by Regina began to<br/>become queasy. Not wanting to begin her time at the school compromised<br/>she pulled the curtains shut, and opened and closed the book she held on<br/>her lap never reading any of it. Regina was constantly rehearsing in her<br/>mind her what she was to do on arriving, who she would meet, who was<br/>related to whom, and then, still being a young girl, wondering if people<br/>would like her, and how long it would take them to figure out she was a<br/>stupid servant.</p><p>Regina felt embarrassed by the prospect, but her dominant feeling was<br/>anger at thinking that if so she would be letting down the Queen. This<br/>anger helped to banish the embarrassment, and to focus Regina on her<br/>task. Replaying the genealogy of the various royal houses helped Regina<br/>to focus and she soon lost her motion sickness. Regina was actually<br/>surprised when she felt the cadence of the carriage change. Then she<br/>heard the rumble of their rutted dirt track change to the clack of<br/>cobblestones beneath their wheels. They were in the town.</p><p>Oh how Regina wanted to open the curtains, and stick her head outside to<br/>gaze at the city and compare it to her dreams and Mietze’s stories.<br/>Regina imagined though that her alter-ego Janus would be more sanguine<br/>about cities, and that it would not help her disguise to appear too much<br/>the rustic. It seemed safer to simply contain herself inside the closed<br/>carriage.</p><p>Regina heard the clatter of footsteps alongside. Shouts. Children. Some<br/>begging, and some cheering. Apparently carriages from the Kaiserkönig<br/>line attracted attention. The voices faded, and there was a knock on the<br/>wall behind her. The sign. They would be entering school soon, the<br/>School for Aristocrats and Diplomats (SAD) at Le Grande Ecole Camford.<br/>Now Regina pulled back the curtains, and then leaned back in a rather<br/>poor imitation of boredom. She saw high buildings to either side. Some<br/>were wood, but most were made of stone. Some of the windows held<br/>on-lookers. Others were empty, and a few aired out laundry for drying.<br/>Then abruptly the buildings disappeared as they went through a stone<br/>arch. Regina found herself entering a broad square courtyard with a<br/>central lawn and buildings on all sides. She could see a small coterie<br/>gathered ahead, and the coach came to a slow stop before them. Herr<br/>Stoll leaped from his place behind to open the door and placed a small<br/>footstool before Regina as a step. Regina arose slowly and came down<br/>carefully, fearful of marking her entrance by tripping on her exit. She<br/>made certain to look neither at Herr Gafner or Herr Stoll.</p><p>Comfortably on solid ground Regina scrutinized the three people before<br/>her. One was clearly a servant. He immediately moved to join Herr Stoll<br/>behind the carriage, presumably to help with Regina’s trunk. The second<br/>was probably another student. She seemed about Regina’s age. For the<br/>third she did not have to guess. This woman stepped forward and bowed<br/>her head briefly. “Greetings. Viscountess Janus. I am Athena Bostick.<br/>Head Mistress.”</p><p>The Head Mistress extended her hand. Regina stared straight into the<br/>Head Mistress’s eyes, and removed one glove before taking the Head<br/>Mistress’s hand in her own. Miss Bostick held it firmly and Regina felt<br/>finger tips probe and palpate. Finally, Miss Bostick released her. “You<br/>must be quite the athlete Viscountess. We have many opportunities for<br/>sport.” Regina did not know why, but Miss Bostick alarmed her. Regina<br/>slid her glove back on quickly. Before she could reply the other student<br/>came forward, and enthusiastically grabbed the gloved hand and pumped<br/>it.</p><p>“Hello Viscountess. I am so happy you’re here. All the kids have been<br/>talking about it. We never thought there would be a Kaiserkönig here.<br/>What did you do?”</p><p>“Miss Andalonia!” the Head Mistress barked. “Please. Some decorum.”</p><p>Regina saw the girl’s eyes tear up, and felt her begin to pull back, but<br/>Regina held on, and looking at the Head Mistress spoke to the girl.<br/>“What a pleasure to make your acquaintance Miss Andalonia.”</p><p>The girl looked with confusion between Regina and the Head Mistress, and<br/>then managed to wiggle her hands out of Regina’s grip. “Sorry Head<br/>Mistress. I was just so excited to meet her. She will be my first<br/>mentee.”</p><p>“Yes. Well one’s anticipation doesn’t excuse assault. We have discussed<br/>this Helene.”</p><p>“Yes Head Mistress.”</p><p>Turning to Regina, the distracted Head Mistress said: “Viscountess Janus<br/>Kaiserkönig, may I present to you Miss Helene Andalonia, daughter of the<br/>Pyrenean Ambassador. She is to be your student guide if that is<br/>acceptable?” The Head Mistress paused. “We call the guide a mentor and<br/>new student a mentee.”</p><p>“Did you say Miss Andalonia was a menteur Head Mistress? That hardly<br/>seems polite.” Regina asked this in a sarcastic tone. This cheek seemed<br/>appropriate to her role, and it came easily since she already disliked<br/>and was suspicious of the Head Mistress. Something in the way the woman<br/>had probed her hand. Regina heard Helene giggle.</p><p>“Non. Je dit un mot Anglais: mentor.”</p><p>“Quelle domage,” replied Regina, “The former would have been so much<br/>more diverting.” Even this bit of pretend patter tired Regina. She was<br/>having to attend to so many things at once, and with a great and unusual<br/>intensity. Regina felt it wise to end the encounter. “Perhaps, I might<br/>be shown to my rooms Miss Bostick.”</p><p>“Yes, of course.” Miss Bostick flipped her hand and the servant with the<br/>trunk began to move up the stairs. “Helene,” Regina asked “would you be<br/>so kind as to show me to my quarters.”</p><p>“Oh yes of course!”</p><p>Regina laced her arm in Helene’s and began to move up the stairs after<br/>the servant. Without looking back at the Head Mistress Regina lifted her<br/>other arm and dismissed the carriage with an exact replica of Miss<br/>Bostick’s own hand flipping gesture. It was a true tribute to the<br/>rigorous discipline and training of the Swiss Guards that Herrn Gafner<br/>and Stoll were able to avoid erupting in guffaws. Hoping their slight<br/>smiles passed as grimaces Gafner and Stoll looked away as the carriage<br/>pulled through the gate, and as Regina disappeared into the school<br/>building.</p></root><a href="chapter10.html">Prior Chapter Preparations</a><p><a href="chapter12.html">Next Chapter Flight of the Bumblebee</a></p></body></html>
