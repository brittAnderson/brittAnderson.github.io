Her attendance was requested more often, sometimes daily. Although she spoke little, the Queen’s children became used to her presence. They smiled to see her there. These teas were only some of her daytime activities. ’Gina was still required to take short shifts with chambermaids and valets, wash sheets, roll out pastry dough, and otherwise perfect her downstairs skills. These domestic training tasks did not free her from scholastic responsibilities as Monsieur Franz began to appear more and more to sit in the kitchen, or the pantry, or the laundry, and to pronounce in French the names of all the items. He made ‘Gina repeat them along with short discussions of her duties. “When we are done,” he pronounced, “you will be able to mop the floors at Versailles with the best of the French petites filles.” ’Gina sweating as she used her hot pad to grab a freshly reddened iron from its place on the grate smiled at the the presumed compliment.</p><p>But when it was dark, and the house stilled (as even the Royal House did from time to time) ‘Gina found herself in her mother’s bed where they rubbed their feet against each other to warm themselves. ’Gina told her Mother stories of the day. ’Gina repeated her lessons from Euclid, or how Albrecht broke the fencing master’s sword, or what a poem was (it seemed to her Mother not much more than a song written by someone too lazy to compose a tune), and once she recited <b>en Français</b> a small <b>conte</b> she had heard of a young girl forced to serve a castle, “just like me Mother”, who later, through magical intervention, wed a Prince and ruled herself. Her Mother loved to hear ‘Gina talk, though she understood very little, but it made ’Gina’s mother worry too for ‘Gina was being made a girl who would not be content with a downstairs life. Her Mother could be satisfied with a peaceful life, a fair food ration, meaningful work, and a royal duty, but could Regina? ‘Gina’s mother gloried in the blossoming of her daughter’s mind and world, and so she beamed smiles as the young girl spoke. ’Gina’s words gradually slowed down, and finally, with a murmured “glass slippers”, she eventually slid into sleep. Then, alone with her thoughts and her daughter’s soft snores making her sleepy, the smile would fade from her mother’s face, and a frown would crease her mother’s brow as she slid into a mother’s worried sleep.</p><p>‘Gina’s frequent tea attendance led to a slight change of family habits. It seemed Mr. Goldthread came to fetch her not only more often, but also earlier. Mr. Goldthread would leave ’Gina alone in one of Mietzie’s beautiful hand me downs, perched on the edge of an uncomfortable chair, afraid to move for creasing the dress or breaking some rule of which she was ignorant. Alone in the vast room where tea was to appear ’Gina would sit and watch servants finish their preparations. They would give ’Gina a wink, and she would allow herself a slight smile and a nod, but all was formal and a bit intimidating. ’Gina knew that the rules with Mietzie in the pantry could not be extended to the upstairs domain. Still, with each early arrival ’Gina became more comfortable. As ’Gina’s early arrivals became more common so too did early arrivals of the Queen’s children.</p><p>First, it was Albrecht. He was striding through the room one day, mud on his boots, crop beating against his thigh, mumbling to himself as he hurriedly went to dress when he saw ‘Gina silent and rigid in her chair.</p><p>“Why Regina! What on Earth are you doing here?”</p><p>“Waiting for tea.” she replied. It was possible that her cheeks reddened, or it may have been the angle of the light.</p><p>“Really? Now? What was Goldthread thinking? We don’t meet for a while. Why don’t you go to Mietzie’s quarters?”</p><p>“Mr. Goldthread was quite specific. My permit is this room, and this room alone. He said he had other matters, and I was to await tea here. He was very direct.”</p><p>“Well. Let’s call Mietzie. You know I know Morse code too. They teach it to the Guards, and one of them taught me. MIETZIE!” he yelled.</p><p>“WHAT?” she screeched back. The cry came faintly echoing back to them, seeming to come from the walls.</p><p>“It’s those corridors you all use. We learned we could talk to each other if we yell loud enough. Mother isn’t too keen on it though.” He said this to ‘Gina. Then loudly “LISTEN!” And he began to jump up and down clomping his boots loudly on the parquet floor. His steps echoed off the walls and through the house, and as he finished, the air became dusty with the dirt kicked up by his boots. One butler opened the door, saw Albrecht apparently dancing, and closed it again. But ‘Gina knew what he had done. He had used Morse code, the clacking and the clomping of the boots, to signal Mietzie she was here. She admired his discretion. A few moments later there came back to them a resonant clacking that translated to, “I’m coming.”</p><p>After this it was more and more often that Albrecht happened through on his way back from his rides. And more and more often Albrecht found Mietzie sitting with the early ‘Gina. Sometimes he changed and sometimes he stayed, and his Mother, the Queen, somehow seemed unaware of his dusty dress on these occasions. Now, more often than not, all the children found themselves in place and chatting when the Queen arrived to ring the official bell that produced the hot pot and cakes which were poured for all, sugar and cream in inverse proportion to ages. For the youngest, it was essentially only sweetened milk.</p><p>The boys spoke of cravats and knights’ fables. The girls spoke of dresses and warrior princesses. Often there was talk of gossip: both upstairs and down, and often it was ‘Gina who ended up talking the most. ’Gina interpreted for the children the whys of peoples actions. The royal children knew only a life of structure and order. For them it came as enlightening that people might do things for other reasons as well. The children enjoyed the downstairs gossip most of all. For them it was the Arabian Nights: tales from a far off land with mysterious motivations and often fantastic creatures (there was actually a man that did nothing besides run the boiler that gave them all hot baths). In reciprocation they talked honestly and openly of their own lives, and seemed to gain some insight in the telling of tales in this context.</p><p>Then one day the tea was interrupted. After the tea had been poured, and Mietzie was just beginning yet another story about her cat, again, a door could be heard to open and close. The sound, though soft, was so uncharacteristic that it led to a pause in the conversation. Mr. Goldthread who generally stood behind ‘Gina’s chair, a point that allowed him to both survey the room, and provide prompting kicks, left suddenly. “Please continue Mietzie,” the Queen said, “What did Chevalier do to Queenie?” But before Mietzie could resume her story Mr. Goldthread reappeared to stand silently behind the Queen’s chair.</p><p>With no other signal, the Queen stood. “Please continue with the tea children. I should not be long.” Then, without a word or glance exchanged, she left the room with Mr. Goldthread a close, but still deferential, distance behind.</p><p>Mietzie found it difficult to resume her story. All the Queen’s children were uneasy at this breech of protocol. ‘Gina was uneasy from sympathy, but did not know what it meant. The children sipped tea, and snacked. Time passed. After a half hour Albrecht observing his youngest siblings beginning to fidget and yawn said “Mother won’t want Arabelle and Abelard to nap at table. I had better take them to their rooms.” And he rose, bowed, and then taking a hand of each of his two sleepy siblings escorted them from the room. Slowly, the other children followed suit. Older sibling escorted out younger ones. The tea grew cold, and Mietzie signaled for the service to be removed. Albrecht returned and sat to the side reading. More time passed. Mietzie turned at last to ‘Gina. “I think it is alright if you go. I will tell Mother I gave you leave.”</p><p>Albrecht looked up to see ‘Gina’s head gazing up in reflection. Then she returned her gaze to Mietzie. “Thank you Mietzie. But although it is Mr. Goldthread who brings me, I know I am here at the Queen’s invitation, and she made it very clear that I was not to leave without being dismissed.”</p><p>“Well that’s just silly. Mother wouldn’t want you sitting here forever. Would she Albrecht?” Albrecht had come to stand beside his sister. Every time ‘Gina saw him lately he seemed to be a little different. He spoke less quickly, and she did not always understand him as she had before. Albrecht placed his free hand on his sister’s shoulder and smiled at her. Then he looked over to ‘Gina. “Here.” He handed the book he had been reading to ‘Gina. “It’s Browning. I mentioned him once, I believe. He’s my favorite.”</p><p>“What?” Mietzie said in surprise. “You don’t really think Mother expects her to stay here forever?”</p><p>“No. I do not. But I also think that ‘Gina can judge for herself what the situation requires.’’ And he was looking sympathetically at ‘Gina when he said it. “We don’t really know what Mother wants when it comes to ‘Gina, but we do know how she has treated servants she felt were disrespectful.’’</p><p>Mietzie did remember such occasions, and she bit her lip. “Come along.” Albrecht said prodding his sister with the hand that rested on her shoulder. Mietzie stood. Gave a little wave, and watched ‘Gina over her shoulder as she went out with her brother. He did not look back.</p><p>‘Gina read. For a while it was rather fun. She was in an upstairs room on her own, with a book, as if she lived here, and for awhile that kept her spirits up. But the light from the window began to dim when the sun had set. A maid came in to clear the few remaining plates and cakes. “What are you still doing here Regina?”</p><p>“The Queen did not dismiss me before she left.”</p><p>“Oh.” For the maid all was clear. “Here.” She took two of the smaller cakes and wrapped them in a napkin. “In case you get hungry later. Hide the napkin under the cushion. I’ll come by or get someone else to come by later to pick it up. And don’t you fret. You’re a good girl. I’m sure the Queen didn’t forget.” But the fact that she then wrapped a second napkin with two more cakes did not make the maid appear confident. “I’ve gotta run love, but I’ll pop by later just to say Hi, and I will let your Mum know why you’re late.”</p><p>Another half an hour and there was not enough light to read. ‘Gina closed the book and allowed herself at last to sit back in the chair. She ate one of the cakes. Then a second. ’Gina placed the napkin under the cushion. After ’Gina had finished the cakes she sat down again. Then ’Gina heard footsteps clicking in a hall. ’Gina hurriedly hid the second napkin behind her. The footsteps came from an unexpected direction, from her right, though ’Gina knew the only public door was to her left. Even the hidden servants access was not on the right. A shaft of light entered the room, and the footsteps were now matched with voices.</p><p>“Oh Heavens Goldthread. It’s like pitch in here. Light a lamp.” It was the Queen’s voice, and ‘Gina saw Goldthread’s silhouette pass in front of her to the sconce near the public door. “What the bloody hell am I supposed to do? Who do I trust?” The frustration and exasperation was clear in the Queen’s voice, and she said this as the light filled the room. Her mouth was opening to speak again when something in Mr. Goldthread’s gaze made her glance to her left where ‘Gina sat, still, on the edge of her chair.</p><p>“Good gracious Regina. You startled me. But…” and the Queen’s voice changed from surprise to anger. “…what are you doing here? You are NOT allowed upstairs unattended and uninvited. You take unfair liberties with our generosity!”</p><p>Regina quickly got down from her chair and bowed, and spoke as she did so. “You did invite me Majesty. For tea.”</p><p>“But that was two hours ago. What made you think you could come back? I simply won’t have it.”</p><p>“I did not come back Majesty. I have never left. You did not dismiss me, and you expressly told me that I was never to leave your presence without an express dismissal. Remember?”</p><p>“But…” the Queen glanced at Mr. Goldthread. To all the world he wore exactly the same neutral expression, but the Queen seemed to see something else, and her tone lightened. “… you have just been sitting here for two hours? In the dark?”</p><p>“No your Majesty.” Regina was still kneeling and bowed on the floor. “Albrecht left me a book to read, until it got dark, and…”</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“One of the maid gave me two cakes to eat while I waited.” This last was blurted out. Regina did not know if she was really allowed to eat the Queen’s tea cakes when there was no one else at tea. And she worried that the Queen would now ask her the maid’s name. Regina had resolved not to tell.</p><p>The Queen continued. “One of the staff knew you were sitting here in the dark, alone, and told no one?”</p><p>There was a faint sound. It might have been a floorboard creak, or the faintest of throat clearings, or it might have been ’Gina’s imagination, but it caused the Queen to glance again at Mr. Goldthread and she sighed, “But you told them I had not dismissed you.”</p><p>“Yes your Majesty.”</p><p>“Stand up my dear. You are dismissed.” And the Queen resumed her walk, limping to where Mr. Goldthread stood.</p><p>“Thank you your Majesty.” and as Regina turned to go she added, “And I hope your gout feels better soon.”</p><p>“What?” The Queen gaped in surprise. “Who told you my gout was bothering me.”</p><p>Regina stopped and bowed her head again. “No one your Majesty. It’s just that you walk the way Cook does sometime, and I know she has the gout, and so I thought …” And then Regina thought that maybe her thoughts were not what the Queen wanted to hear about so she shut her mouth tight.</p><p>“Very observant you are, and perhaps a bit too clever, but anyway, yes, my gout is bothering me a bit, but that I am afraid is not the real cause of my distress. Or my forgetfulness. Please accept my excuse for detaining you at tea…” Queens do not apologize even when they are wrong, “ and, again, you are dismissed.”</p><p>“Thank you your majesty.” and as Regina, innocent Regina, turned to go, her heart began to warm again for the Queen who had been so understanding, and had so much upon her mind. So she added. “… and I hope you catch the spy.”</p><p>It was as if thunder had clapped within the tea room. “What!” came the loud cry from the Queen, and then louder still. “Sit!” with all the Royal imperative of decades of practice, and more commanding still, “Who has told you there is a spy?”</p><p>That the Queen, in her younger days, used to once raise her voice was a legend among the staff. Some had heard it, to be sure. The older maids and butlers, those who had been in service when the Queen was but a Princess, and had not yet grown into her position, status, wisdom, and capacity. But since she had been a mother not a single one of the Queen’s children had heard their Mother’s voice raised in anger. So there began in response to this loud command a distant wailing that came from the nursery. Moments later Mietzie, followed by Albrecht with his training epee drawn (and the point still protected by its cork), burst into the room. As they saw the scene, Mr. Goldthread standing quietly by the lamp, and their Mother taller than they remembered glowering down on young Regina, they slid to a stop. The Queen looked at Mietzie. “Out!” she said, and Mietzie fled. Then she turned to Albrecht preparing to speak again, but paused. He met her gaze. Lowered his foil, and then went and stood against the wall. The Queen followed him with a fierce gaze, but shortly turned away and addressed herself again to Regina.</p><p>“Sit!” I say, “Who has told you such a thing?” She commanded, and her tone suggested she knew of no other outcome than an answer. Mr. Goldthread, responding to some unspoken command, returned to stand behind Regina’s chair, who sat shrinking but silent. Albrecht folded his arms and leaned against the wall.</p><p>“I said,…” the Queen’s voice, though it had not seem possible a moment earlier, became even more commanding, more imperative (or perhaps it only seemed that way because every other castle noise had ceased). The Queen’s order resonated and echoed down every silent corridor. “Who-has-told-you-such-a-thing?”</p><p>Regina’ raised her head, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen limped closer, wincing with each step. “There will be no more teas for you, EVER, if you do not reply to me.”</p><p>Tears rolled down Regina’s cheeks, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen bowed forward to stare closer at ’Gina’s face, and then straightening, reflected. “And there will be no more DOWNSTAIRS CATS!”</p><p>The Queen’s face reddened with the force of her expostulation.</p><p>At this Regina’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the tears ceased to fall, and still she did not speak.</p><p>“If you do not answer me, if you do not confess the source of your insinuation, I will have your Mother, just your Mother, transferred to the Summer castle!”</p><p>And with this Regina cheeks became wet again, and her lips began to tremble, they opened once, then they shut again, and still she did not speak.</p><p>“Mother! We told her it was a secret!” Albrecht yelled, but before he could continue, she yelled back, “Silence! Of course I knew it was you children, but I did not know that God could make in one so young, such a brave and loyal subject, one who would be willing to lose privileges, pets, and family to keep her word.”</p><p>The Queen went forward, with effort going down on her own knees so that her eyes were level with the young girl’s. One hand brushed a teary cheek, and she placed her forehead against Regina’s own. “Forgive me my dear for this cruel test; it was despicable, but I had to know. You see only the delights and flash of royal prerogative. Parties, and lace, and ample cakes, but you do not see the deceit and envy and want that constantly claws at one’s royal back. You do not see the intrigues and the games that are constantly played against one, and you do not know the loneliness that accompanies the complete absence of confidence that is a Royal’s lot. I am lucky to have a few that I can trust, and I cannot tell you how happy it makes me feel to know that my children too have at least one other that they can trust, some day their lives may depend upon it, and you.”</p><p>Regina did not quite follow all that was said, but she knew their were more tears on her cheeks now than she alone had shed, and she felt her chair bump once from behind, a comforting pat of approval from the knee of Mr. Goldthread. Without reflecting ’Gina put her arms around the Queen’s neck and sobbed.</p></root><a href="chapter4.html">Prior Chapter \#Friendship</a><p><a href="chapter6.html">Next Chapter An Education</a></p></body></html>
