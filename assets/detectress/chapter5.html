Her attendance was requested more often, sometimes daily.Although she spoke little, the Queen’s children became used to herpresence. They smiled to see her there. These teas were only some of herdaytime activities. ’Gina was still required to take short shifts withchambermaids and valets, wash sheets, roll out pastry dough, andotherwise perfect her downstairs skills. These domestic training tasksdid not free her from scholastic responsibilities as Monsieur Franzbegan to appear more and more to sit in the kitchen, or the pantry, orthe laundry, and to pronounce in French the names of all the items. Hemade ‘Gina repeat them along with short discussions of her duties. “Whenwe are done,” he pronounced, “you will be able to mop the floors atVersailles with the best of the French petites filles.” ’Gina sweatingas she used her hot pad to grab a freshly reddened iron from its placeon the grate smiled at the the presumed compliment.</p><p>But when it was dark, and the house stilled (as even the Royal House didfrom time to time) ‘Gina found herself in her mother’s bed where theyrubbed their feet against each other to warm themselves. ’Gina told herMother stories of the day. ’Gina repeated her lessons from Euclid, orhow Albrecht broke the fencing master’s sword, or what a poem was (itseemed to her Mother not much more than a song written by someone toolazy to compose a tune), and once she recited <b>en Français</b> a small<b>conte</b> she had heard of a young girl forced to serve a castle, “justlike me Mother”, who later, through magical intervention, wed a Princeand ruled herself. Her Mother loved to hear ‘Gina talk, though sheunderstood very little, but it made ’Gina’s mother worry too for ‘Ginawas being made a girl who would not be content with a downstairs life.Her Mother could be satisfied with a peaceful life, a fair food ration,meaningful work, and a royal duty, but could Regina? ‘Gina’s mothergloried in the blossoming of her daughter’s mind and world, and so shebeamed smiles as the young girl spoke. ’Gina’s words gradually sloweddown, and finally, with a murmured “glass slippers”, she eventually slidinto sleep. Then, alone with her thoughts and her daughter’s soft snoresmaking her sleepy, the smile would fade from her mother’s face, and afrown would crease her mother’s brow as she slid into a mother’s worriedsleep.</p><p>‘Gina’s frequent tea attendance led to a slight change of family habits.It seemed Mr. Goldthread came to fetch her not only more often, but alsoearlier. Mr. Goldthread would leave ’Gina alone in one of Mietzie’sbeautiful hand me downs, perched on the edge of an uncomfortable chair,afraid to move for creasing the dress or breaking some rule of which shewas ignorant. Alone in the vast room where tea was to appear ’Gina wouldsit and watch servants finish their preparations. They would give ’Ginaa wink, and she would allow herself a slight smile and a nod, but allwas formal and a bit intimidating. ’Gina knew that the rules withMietzie in the pantry could not be extended to the upstairs domain.Still, with each early arrival ’Gina became more comfortable. As ’Gina’searly arrivals became more common so too did early arrivals of theQueen’s children.</p><p>First, it was Albrecht. He was striding through the room one day, mud onhis boots, crop beating against his thigh, mumbling to himself as hehurriedly went to dress when he saw ‘Gina silent and rigid in her chair.</p><p>“Why Regina! What on Earth are you doing here?”</p><p>“Waiting for tea.” she replied. It was possible that her cheeksreddened, or it may have been the angle of the light.</p><p>“Really? Now? What was Goldthread thinking? We don’t meet for a while.Why don’t you go to Mietzie’s quarters?”</p><p>“Mr. Goldthread was quite specific. My permit is this room, and thisroom alone. He said he had other matters, and I was to await tea here.He was very direct.”</p><p>“Well. Let’s call Mietzie. You know I know Morse code too. They teach itto the Guards, and one of them taught me. MIETZIE!” he yelled.</p><p>“WHAT?” she screeched back. The cry came faintly echoing back to them,seeming to come from the walls.</p><p>“It’s those corridors you all use. We learned we could talk to eachother if we yell loud enough. Mother isn’t too keen on it though.” Hesaid this to ‘Gina. Then loudly “LISTEN!” And he began to jump up anddown clomping his boots loudly on the parquet floor. His steps echoedoff the walls and through the house, and as he finished, the air becamedusty with the dirt kicked up by his boots. One butler opened the door,saw Albrecht apparently dancing, and closed it again. But ‘Gina knewwhat he had done. He had used Morse code, the clacking and the clompingof the boots, to signal Mietzie she was here. She admired hisdiscretion. A few moments later there came back to them a resonantclacking that translated to, “I’m coming.”</p><p>After this it was more and more often that Albrecht happened through onhis way back from his rides. And more and more often Albrecht foundMietzie sitting with the early ‘Gina. Sometimes he changed and sometimeshe stayed, and his Mother, the Queen, somehow seemed unaware of hisdusty dress on these occasions. Now, more often than not, all thechildren found themselves in place and chatting when the Queen arrivedto ring the official bell that produced the hot pot and cakes which werepoured for all, sugar and cream in inverse proportion to ages. For theyoungest, it was essentially only sweetened milk.</p><p>The boys spoke of cravats and knights’ fables. The girls spoke ofdresses and warrior princesses. Often there was talk of gossip: bothupstairs and down, and often it was ‘Gina who ended up talking the most.’Gina interpreted for the children the whys of peoples actions. Theroyal children knew only a life of structure and order. For them it cameas enlightening that people might do things for other reasons as well.The children enjoyed the downstairs gossip most of all. For them it wasthe Arabian Nights: tales from a far off land with mysteriousmotivations and often fantastic creatures (there was actually a man thatdid nothing besides run the boiler that gave them all hot baths). Inreciprocation they talked honestly and openly of their own lives, andseemed to gain some insight in the telling of tales in this context.</p><p>Then one day the tea was interrupted. After the tea had been poured, andMietzie was just beginning yet another story about her cat, again, adoor could be heard to open and close. The sound, though soft, was souncharacteristic that it led to a pause in the conversation. Mr.Goldthread who generally stood behind ‘Gina’s chair, a point thatallowed him to both survey the room, and provide prompting kicks, leftsuddenly. “Please continue Mietzie,” the Queen said, “What did Chevalierdo to Queenie?” But before Mietzie could resume her story Mr. Goldthreadreappeared to stand silently behind the Queen’s chair.</p><p>With no other signal, the Queen stood. “Please continue with the teachildren. I should not be long.” Then, without a word or glanceexchanged, she left the room with Mr. Goldthread a close, but stilldeferential, distance behind.</p><p>Mietzie found it difficult to resume her story. All the Queen’s childrenwere uneasy at this breech of protocol. ‘Gina was uneasy from sympathy,but did not know what it meant. The children sipped tea, and snacked.Time passed. After a half hour Albrecht observing his youngest siblingsbeginning to fidget and yawn said “Mother won’t want Arabelle andAbelard to nap at table. I had better take them to their rooms.” And herose, bowed, and then taking a hand of each of his two sleepy siblingsescorted them from the room. Slowly, the other children followed suit.Older sibling escorted out younger ones. The tea grew cold, and Mietziesignaled for the service to be removed. Albrecht returned and sat to theside reading. More time passed. Mietzie turned at last to ‘Gina. “Ithink it is alright if you go. I will tell Mother I gave you leave.”</p><p>Albrecht looked up to see ‘Gina’s head gazing up in reflection. Then shereturned her gaze to Mietzie. “Thank you Mietzie. But although it is Mr.Goldthread who brings me, I know I am here at the Queen’s invitation,and she made it very clear that I was not to leave without beingdismissed.”</p><p>“Well that’s just silly. Mother wouldn’t want you sitting here forever.Would she Albrecht?” Albrecht had come to stand beside his sister. Everytime ‘Gina saw him lately he seemed to be a little different. He spokeless quickly, and she did not always understand him as she had before.Albrecht placed his free hand on his sister’s shoulder and smiled ather. Then he looked over to ‘Gina. “Here.” He handed the book he hadbeen reading to ‘Gina. “It’s Browning. I mentioned him once, I believe.He’s my favorite.”</p><p>“What?” Mietzie said in surprise. “You don’t really think Mother expectsher to stay here forever?”</p><p>“No. I do not. But I also think that ‘Gina can judge for herself whatthe situation requires.’’ And he was looking sympathetically at ‘Ginawhen he said it. “We don’t really know what Mother wants when it comesto ‘Gina, but we do know how she has treated servants she felt weredisrespectful.’’</p><p>Mietzie did remember such occasions, and she bit her lip. “Come along.”Albrecht said prodding his sister with the hand that rested on hershoulder. Mietzie stood. Gave a little wave, and watched ‘Gina over hershoulder as she went out with her brother. He did not look back.</p><p>‘Gina read. For a while it was rather fun. She was in an upstairs roomon her own, with a book, as if she lived here, and for awhile that kepther spirits up. But the light from the window began to dim when the sunhad set. A maid came in to clear the few remaining plates and cakes.“What are you still doing here Regina?”</p><p>“The Queen did not dismiss me before she left.”</p><p>“Oh.” For the maid all was clear. “Here.” She took two of the smallercakes and wrapped them in a napkin. “In case you get hungry later. Hidethe napkin under the cushion. I’ll come by or get someone else to comeby later to pick it up. And don’t you fret. You’re a good girl. I’m surethe Queen didn’t forget.” But the fact that she then wrapped a secondnapkin with two more cakes did not make the maid appear confident. “I’vegotta run love, but I’ll pop by later just to say Hi, and I will letyour Mum know why you’re late.”</p><p>Another half an hour and there was not enough light to read. ‘Ginaclosed the book and allowed herself at last to sit back in the chair.She ate one of the cakes. Then a second. ’Gina placed the napkin underthe cushion. After ’Gina had finished the cakes she sat down again. Then’Gina heard footsteps clicking in a hall. ’Gina hurriedly hid the secondnapkin behind her. The footsteps came from an unexpected direction, fromher right, though ’Gina knew the only public door was to her left. Eventhe hidden servants access was not on the right. A shaft of lightentered the room, and the footsteps were now matched with voices.</p><p>“Oh Heavens Goldthread. It’s like pitch in here. Light a lamp.” It wasthe Queen’s voice, and ‘Gina saw Goldthread’s silhouette pass in frontof her to the sconce near the public door. “What the bloody hell am Isupposed to do? Who do I trust?” The frustration and exasperation wasclear in the Queen’s voice, and she said this as the light filled theroom. Her mouth was opening to speak again when something in Mr.Goldthread’s gaze made her glance to her left where ‘Gina sat, still, onthe edge of her chair.</p><p>“Good gracious Regina. You startled me. But…” and the Queen’s voicechanged from surprise to anger. “…what are you doing here? You are NOTallowed upstairs unattended and uninvited. You take unfair libertieswith our generosity!”</p><p>Regina quickly got down from her chair and bowed, and spoke as she didso. “You did invite me Majesty. For tea.”</p><p>“But that was two hours ago. What made you think you could come back? Isimply won’t have it.”</p><p>“I did not come back Majesty. I have never left. You did not dismiss me,and you expressly told me that I was never to leave your presencewithout an express dismissal. Remember?”</p><p>“But…” the Queen glanced at Mr. Goldthread. To all the world he woreexactly the same neutral expression, but the Queen seemed to seesomething else, and her tone lightened. “… you have just been sittinghere for two hours? In the dark?”</p><p>“No your Majesty.” Regina was still kneeling and bowed on the floor.“Albrecht left me a book to read, until it got dark, and…”</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“One of the maid gave me two cakes to eat while I waited.” This last wasblurted out. Regina did not know if she was really allowed to eat theQueen’s tea cakes when there was no one else at tea. And she worriedthat the Queen would now ask her the maid’s name. Regina had resolvednot to tell.</p><p>The Queen continued. “One of the staff knew you were sitting here in thedark, alone, and told no one?”</p><p>There was a faint sound. It might have been a floorboard creak, or thefaintest of throat clearings, or it might have been ’Gina’s imagination,but it caused the Queen to glance again at Mr. Goldthread and shesighed, “But you told them I had not dismissed you.”</p><p>“Yes your Majesty.”</p><p>“Stand up my dear. You are dismissed.” And the Queen resumed her walk,limping to where Mr. Goldthread stood.</p><p>“Thank you your Majesty.” and as Regina turned to go she added, “And Ihope your gout feels better soon.”</p><p>“What?” The Queen gaped in surprise. “Who told you my gout was botheringme.”</p><p>Regina stopped and bowed her head again. “No one your Majesty. It’s justthat you walk the way Cook does sometime, and I know she has the gout,and so I thought …” And then Regina thought that maybe her thoughtswere not what the Queen wanted to hear about so she shut her mouthtight.</p><p>“Very observant you are, and perhaps a bit too clever, but anyway, yes,my gout is bothering me a bit, but that I am afraid is not the realcause of my distress. Or my forgetfulness. Please accept my excuse fordetaining you at tea…” Queens do not apologize even when they arewrong, “ and, again, you are dismissed.”</p><p>“Thank you your majesty.” and as Regina, innocent Regina, turned to go,her heart began to warm again for the Queen who had been sounderstanding, and had so much upon her mind. So she added. “… and Ihope you catch the spy.”</p><p>It was as if thunder had clapped within the tea room. “What!” came theloud cry from the Queen, and then louder still. “Sit!” with all theRoyal imperative of decades of practice, and more commanding still, “Whohas told you there is a spy?”</p><p>That the Queen, in her younger days, used to once raise her voice was alegend among the staff. Some had heard it, to be sure. The older maidsand butlers, those who had been in service when the Queen was but aPrincess, and had not yet grown into her position, status, wisdom, andcapacity. But since she had been a mother not a single one of theQueen’s children had heard their Mother’s voice raised in anger. Sothere began in response to this loud command a distant wailing that camefrom the nursery. Moments later Mietzie, followed by Albrecht with histraining epee drawn (and the point still protected by its cork), burstinto the room. As they saw the scene, Mr. Goldthread standing quietly bythe lamp, and their Mother taller than they remembered glowering down onyoung Regina, they slid to a stop. The Queen looked at Mietzie. “Out!”she said, and Mietzie fled. Then she turned to Albrecht preparing tospeak again, but paused. He met her gaze. Lowered his foil, and thenwent and stood against the wall. The Queen followed him with a fiercegaze, but shortly turned away and addressed herself again to Regina.</p><p>“Sit!” I say, “Who has told you such a thing?” She commanded, and hertone suggested she knew of no other outcome than an answer. Mr.Goldthread, responding to some unspoken command, returned to standbehind Regina’s chair, who sat shrinking but silent. Albrecht folded hisarms and leaned against the wall.</p><p>“I said,…” the Queen’s voice, though it had not seem possible a momentearlier, became even more commanding, more imperative (or perhaps itonly seemed that way because every other castle noise had ceased). TheQueen’s order resonated and echoed down every silent corridor.“Who-has-told-you-such-a-thing?”</p><p>Regina’ raised her head, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen limped closer, wincing with each step. “There will be no moreteas for you, EVER, if you do not reply to me.”</p><p>Tears rolled down Regina’s cheeks, but still she did not speak.</p><p>The Queen bowed forward to stare closer at ’Gina’s face, and thenstraightening, reflected. “And there will be no more DOWNSTAIRS CATS!”</p><p>The Queen’s face reddened with the force of her expostulation.</p><p>At this Regina’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the tears ceased to fall,and still she did not speak.</p><p>“If you do not answer me, if you do not confess the source of yourinsinuation, I will have your Mother, just your Mother, transferred tothe Summer castle!”</p><p>And with this Regina cheeks became wet again, and her lips began totremble, they opened once, then they shut again, and still she did notspeak.</p><p>“Mother! We told her it was a secret!” Albrecht yelled, but before hecould continue, she yelled back, “Silence! Of course I knew it was youchildren, but I did not know that God could make in one so young, such abrave and loyal subject, one who would be willing to lose privileges,pets, and family to keep her word.”</p><p>The Queen went forward, with effort going down on her own knees so thather eyes were level with the young girl’s. One hand brushed a tearycheek, and she placed her forehead against Regina’s own. “Forgive me mydear for this cruel test; it was despicable, but I had to know. You seeonly the delights and flash of royal prerogative. Parties, and lace, andample cakes, but you do not see the deceit and envy and want thatconstantly claws at one’s royal back. You do not see the intrigues andthe games that are constantly played against one, and you do not knowthe loneliness that accompanies the complete absence of confidence thatis a Royal’s lot. I am lucky to have a few that I can trust, and Icannot tell you how happy it makes me feel to know that my children toohave at least one other that they can trust, some day their lives maydepend upon it, and you.”</p><p>Regina did not quite follow all that was said, but she knew their weremore tears on her cheeks now than she alone had shed, and she felt herchair bump once from behind, a comforting pat of approval from the kneeof Mr. Goldthread. Without reflecting ’Gina put her arms around theQueen’s neck and sobbed.</p></root><a href="chapter4.html">Prior Chapter \#Friendship</a><p><a href="chapter6.html">Next Chapter An Education</a></p></body></html>
