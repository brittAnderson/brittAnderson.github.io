Her status as a Queen’s agent had not affected<br/>the formality with which she was treated nor any apparent alteration in<br/>her downstairs status. Slowly the room filled with the Queen’s children.<br/>Polite chatter began. The little ones asked after ’Gina’s cat, Queenie,<br/>who they much preferred to the Mietzie’s fat and pampered one, and ’Gina<br/>told them a short tale involving Cook and some disappearing fish<br/>fillets. Still the conversation did not flow as it usually did. Perhaps<br/>it was the absence of Albrecht and Mietzie that led to the different,<br/>less friendly feeling. Or it may only have been ’Gina who felt Mietzie’s<br/>and Albrecht’s absences as disapproving.</p><p>Shortly before the Queen was to appear, Mietzie entered with Albrecht<br/>providing encouragement from behind (in a non-royal household it would<br/>have been called “pushing“). Mietzie began to walk toward the chair<br/>furthest from ’Gina, and it was only when Albrecht cleared his throat<br/>with a noise like a cannon shot that Mietzie redirected course and took<br/>the one on ’Gina’s side. After a moment Mietzie leaned in and could be<br/>seen whispering into ’Gina’s ear with animation and emotion. After which<br/>’Gina gave a small, sad shake of her head. Mietzie made an audible<br/>“harrumph!” and staring straight at Albrecht got up and began to march<br/>toward an open chair on the opposite side of the tea circle. She was<br/>pointedly ignoring the hive like humming that was Albrecht’s repeated,<br/>loud, and ineffectual throat clearings.</p><p>It was into this syncopated contest of discontented grunting that the<br/>Queen made her entrance with Mr. Goldthread by her side. All grew<br/>silent, and the children all stood, except for ’Gina who bowed with her<br/>head held low. The Queen took in the situation with her glance, but<br/>ignored it. “Sit Children, please.” With this invitation servants<br/>appeared to pour the tea, and Albrecht exchanged a look and a shrug with<br/>his Mother who slightly shook her head. The Queen initiated<br/>conversations with questions, and all were answered politely, but no<br/>response led to further comments and the tea took the tenor of a<br/>magistrate’s inquiry.</p><p>The Queen was regal. She was cool, and contained. She sipped her tea in<br/>a relaxed and elegant fashion. She too inquired after Queenie (she too<br/>preferred Queenie to Mietzie’s fat, spoiled Chevalier. In fact, other<br/>than Mietzie, it was only ‘Gina who liked Chevalier, and only ’Gina that<br/>Chevalier allowed to pick him up (besides Mietzie of course)). After the<br/>Queen had finished her cup of tea, taken a bite of a <b>petit four</b> and<br/>then one taste of a cucumber sandwich ala Oscar Wilde, she felt that her<br/>obligation to appear unhurried, and unprovoked had been met. The Queen<br/>suggested an early end to today’s tea with the statement “There is still<br/>much royal work to be done today children. Perhaps you will allow an<br/>early adjournment?” Of course, one only assented to the Queen’s queries,<br/>but on this occasion the agreeing nods of the children were sincere. The<br/>Queen stood and made eye contact with Albrecht who returned it with<br/>something approaching a glower. The Queen gave a slight nod, and a<br/>slighter sigh. “Mietzie, ’Gina. Remain a moment won’t you.” Then with a<br/>look over her shoulder she some how provoked Mr. Goldthread into<br/>producing the assorted nanny’s and tutors that supervised the remaining<br/>children to appear and fetch their charges away. Albrecht too remained,<br/>and the Queen noted this, but said nothing.</p><p>“Please sit. Children,” the Queen said. Albrecht remained standing to<br/>the side while Mietzie and ’Gina each sat in their places at the far<br/>arcs of the tea circle seating.</p><p>The Queen looked at Albrecht, who gave a nod toward Mietzie. The Queen<br/>glanced at her daughter, but then turned and spoke first to ’Gina. “You<br/>do keep your secrets, don’t you,” and then with a bit of annoyance<br/>creeping in, “And what is going on with you Mietzie?”</p><p>“She’s keeping secrets from me. I ordered her to tell me. And she has to<br/>do what I order because I am a Princess and she is… She is … Well!<br/>You need to punish her!”</p><p>“Punishing ’Gina is not the first thing that comes to mind,” the Queen<br/>replied icily, “You are the one in need of lessons I am afraid. And…”<br/>she paused, continuing with a calmer voice, “but the responsibility is<br/>mine. You do as I do. You spoil your cat, because I spoil you. You feel<br/>entitled, because I have taught you to feel entitled. I have made your<br/>brother see the responsibilities that come with his privileges, but I<br/>share with you only the expectations of obedience, never the obligation<br/>to serve.”</p><p>“To serve? You never serve.” Mietzie replied. ’Gina squirmed. She was<br/>not used to, and was made uncomfortable by, seeing this family squabble.<br/>She had the thought to excuse herself, when the clairvoyant Mr.<br/>Goldthread stilled her motion before it began with a light tapping of<br/>his knee on her chair.</p><p>“I only serve!” the Queen boomed. “I serve my family. I serve in my<br/>position. I serve my country. You serve only yourself.”</p><p>“Mother.” Albrecht said.</p><p>The Queen quickly turned on him, but on seeing him relaxed her knotted<br/>shoulders, and smiled. “You are the better part of both your Father and<br/>me.” then turning to Mietzie. “Mietzie. ’Gina has done what I commanded.<br/>I told her something, and bade her not repeat it, and that she has done.<br/>You could have used a bit more of your deductive talents, which I know<br/>you to have, and pondered why ’Gina was not obeying your order? First,<br/>why would a <b>commoner</b> deny you, but more importantly why would your<br/>friend not confide in you? Having thought on that you would have<br/>recognized there was more to understand, even if you could not determine<br/>what it was. Here is today’s lesson: respond to your confusion with<br/>reflection rather than reflex. And here is today’s advice: friends for<br/>royals are few and far between, do not take them lightly.” Then turning<br/>back to Albrecht she asked, “Well?”</p><p>“Tell her Mother, I think. It will make ’Gina’s life easier to not have<br/>Mietzie feuding with her at this point. She can use her friend back too,<br/>I think, and it just might help Mietzie learn your lesson. I think<br/>Mietzie might do better if you gave her more opportunities to<br/>demonstrate it.”</p><p>Mietzie stood up straighter, and looked at her brother appreciatively.<br/>It was true, she thought, she did want to do things. It was just that<br/>there wasn’t much for her to do, but get dressed, go to lessons, teas,<br/>parties, military ceremonies, music lessons, riding parties, and visits<br/>to distant cousins who spoke guttural tongues, and slurped their tea.</p><p>“I have assigner her a … mission.” the Queen announced.</p><p>Mietzie looked straight at ’Gina and immediately flushed red with anger.<br/>Her mouth opened in preparation to protest, but then her better nature<br/>made her pause, and she thought about Mother’s reflex and reflect. Why<br/>would her Mother give ’Gina a mission and not her? Why could no one<br/>speak of it? Why must no one know about it, even her and her siblings?<br/>And as long as she was wondering at things new and unexplained, why was<br/>her Mother staying up so late, and appearing so fatigued and tired, and<br/>why had she stopped eating breakfast, and why had her meetings with Mr.<br/>Goldthread and her other advisers lengthened?</p><p>Mietzie spoke again. Calmly. “It’s important, and…” she paused in<br/>thought again and then the connection sparked, “it’s dangerous!” Then<br/>reflex overrode reflection and Mietzie ran to ’Gina and hugged her. “You<br/>can do it.” she said. “You’re so clever, and honorable. I know you can<br/>do it. Whatever it is. What is it Mother? Let me help Mother. Please?”</p><p>And then even though no one had seen or heard any movement, the Queen<br/>asked, “Well Goldthread. Out with it. I can see you’re about to burst<br/>wanting to say something.”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread replied in his consistent, sonorous and calm voice. “I<br/>believe Prince Albrecht has a suggestion.”</p><p>“I do?” Albrecht looked deeply puzzled.</p><p>“I believe you do Sir,” Mr. Goldthread continued. “I distinctly remember<br/>you remarking that the status of Regina’s impersonation would be<br/>significantly enhanced by having at least one servant permanently<br/>resident with her.”</p><p>“Well, I did say that, and I think it’s true, but I do not see what that<br/>has to do with … OH!” and then more speaking to himself than the<br/>others, “Mietzie? Really? Well why not? It could be a good learning<br/>experience for Mietzie.” then, louder, to the others. “Yes, Why not?<br/>Mietzie could go as ’Gina’s servant.”</p><p>“Really? That’s quite impossible. She would be immediately recog…” the<br/>Queen broke off, and made eye contact with Mr. Goldthread. “Yes, on<br/>reflection.” with a nod to Mietzie, “maybe it could work after all. Yes<br/>Albrecht, maybe it could work.”</p><p>“Of course it could work!” Mietzie exulted, then asked, “What could work<br/>exactly?”</p><p>’Gina turned to her. “I am going to be sent to school. Le Grande Ecole<br/>Camford. I am going disguised as the rich daughter of one of your<br/>Mother’s cousins. There are some things I am supposed to learn there.”</p><p>“Well of course you’ll learn things at school, but why…Oh! <b>learn</b><br/>there. I get it. You’re going to be a spy!”</p><p>“I think not.” the Queen interjected. “Better one say an observer. There<br/>will be no skulduggery or escapades. Regina will be entirely a student,<br/>and like all students will work and study and play. It is perhaps<br/>possible that she may hear some gossip that she believes may be of<br/>interest to me, but she is not, and I repeat not,” here with a stony<br/>stare at ’Gina, “to go investigating.”</p><p>“This will be such fun.” said Mietzie. “We will have such fun together.<br/>I will be ever so helpful as your servant, and in your not<br/>investigating.”</p><p>“What do you know about being a servant Mietzie? You have enough trouble<br/>behaving like a Princess.” Albrecht added.</p><p>“Right you are Albrecht“ said the Queen.”And given your analysis of the<br/>situation, and since it was after all, and to your credit, your idea, I<br/>charge you with the supervision of Mietzie’s lessons in basic servitude.<br/>Please keep me fully informed of her progress.”</p></root><a href="chapter6">Prior Chapter An Education</a><p><a href="chapter8">Next Chapter Mucking</a></p></body></html>
