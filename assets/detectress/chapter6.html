It was early and cold. Few lamps were lit, and evena thin layer of dust could be found on some of the polished surfaces. Itwas not a room that had been meant for a meeting today. Neither theQueen nor her staff would have been satisfied with these conditions.’Gina looked across at her Mother sitting in the chair next to her. HerMother seemed very nervous, and sat so rigid and so far forward on theedge of her chair that ’Gina was unsure if the chair was actuallysupporting her Mother at all or if her Mother was just hovering in theair in a squat.</p><p>’Gina’s Mother’s eyes toggled back and forth between the two men in thecrisp black suits who had escorted them up from downstairs. They weretwo of Mr. Goldthread’s surrogates, his <b>gents</b> is how he referred tothem. The Gents dressed as Mr. Goldthread did. They wore plain whiteshirts, black ties and shoes. From the breast pockets of their creasedblack suits emerged creased white handkerchief’s folded to reveal threepoints as sharp as pitchfork tines. Regina had noticed the only glimpseof color to be found upon them while going up the stairs. One of theGents was in front and the other followed right behind. With each stepthe Gent in front of her took Regina saw flash a small embroideredsquare of red with a white cross set inside.</p><p>These men were neither of the upstairs nor downstairs. They lived in abig building by the stables where they kept to themselves and did theirown meals and laundry. They were known, of course, to the staff, butthey did not visit, and they did not chat. The Gents floated like blackclad ghosts in the background of the Queen’s retinue, were seen tomingle in the crowd at public days, and would quietly swoop to bendtheir heads close to Mr. Goldthread’s in some whispered communicationbefore silently taking their leave. Their quiet nature was so consistentthat it was rumored by the stable boys (who in tending to the horses hadthe closest glimpses) that some of them might even be mute. While theywere men of many races, they still managed in most ways to look alike.They wore their hair cut close, kept faces shaved, and most had flat,broken noses. All of them bore muscles that strained the seams of theirtailored restraints.</p><p>Word had been sent that Mr. Goldthread needed a gent or two to escortthe <b>ladies</b> - he was pointed in his use of this term - to this room atthis time. And because they were <b>ladies</b> the agents were respectful anddeferential in their requests, but because they were Mr. Goldthread’smen they were also insistent, and they did not say why or where Reginaand her Mother were being taken.</p><p>Regina’s Mother, looking once more to her right, once more to her left,eyed the ebony trunks that stood watchful to each side. She leaned intowards Regina and whispered: “What’s doing little one?” And Reginacould only shake her head a little from side to side in ignorance. Shetoo glanced from right to left. Forgetting her fear, it being edged outby her curiosity, she had an idea that rapidly became too big for herhead. To release the pressure she opened the valve that was her voice.</p><p>“They’re Swiss Mother!” Regina then immediately began to wonder why? WhySwiss men as Mr. Goldthread’s ’gents? Regina gazed up and faraway to lether thoughts grind on. Then another thought bubble burst. “Swiss Guards.Just like the Pope!”</p><p>Neither of the men flinched, but one turned his head ever so slightly tolook at Regina. It was only due to her long practice with Mr. Goldthreadthat she felt sure she detected a smile. Her Mother saw nothing buttheir vigilant gazes. “Oh! Oh!” Regina could not stop the momentum ofher thought, “The Queen is worried for herself…” and looking from sideto side again at each of Goldthread’s gents, “and for us too?”</p><p>“Really?” her Mother asked. “Why should Her Majesty be worried for amaid and her daughter?” Her Mother’s effort to console herself and herdaughter was not persuasive. This attempt to dismiss the seriousness ofthe gathering was refuted by its very nature: an escort of Swiss Guardstaking place in the Queen’s tea room before dusting time. She and Reginabecame quiet again, and returned to their quiet waiting. Goldthread’sgents kept up their quiet watching.</p><p>Five minutes later the Queen entered followed by Mr. Goldthread. Bothguards stood to attention, and both Regina and her Mother stood andbowed. “My Dears,” the Queen spoke, “Please be seated.”</p><p>At a wave of her arm a chair appeared, and the Queen sat down acrossfrom Regina and her Mother. “Where is Albrecht?” the Queen asked the’gent to Regina’s right. He answered with a stony Goldthread glare.“Well I don’t care.” she replied, “Fetch him!” Then to Regina and herMother, “Another moment, please.”</p><p>A short moment later Albrecht appeared with his night shirt tucked intothe pants of his regimental uniform. He had one boot on, and the otherin his hand. He hopped in. His hair pointed to heaven and flopped witheach leap forwarded as he tried to walk and put on his other boot at thesame time. Seeing the scene before him he became at once professional.Dropping the boot he too stood to attention. “Good Morning Mother,” hesaid.</p><p>“Good Morning Albrecht,” she replied, “Now,” she said focusing on ’Gina.“ What do you observe about me?”</p><p>“Well. First, your gout is better. You walked in quite briskly.”</p><p>“Yes my gout is better. And I have you to thank for that. I consultedwith Cook, who you told me had the same affliction, and she recommendeda remarkable poultice she gets from some village woman. Cook is alsogoing to be cooking me some simpler meals, and I suspect that will helpher gout more than mine since she seems to consume more in tasting herpreparations than I in their eating.” And here the Queen smiled, “Whatelse child?” Her gaze narrowed in a concentrated study of the younggirl.</p><p>Regina reflected before speaking. She looked back at the Queen and thenaround at each of the other occupants of the room. Then for a moment sheturned her head towards the ceiling. She seemed not to see it. Returningto a level gaze, ’Gina said, “You are worried. For yourself, and foryour household, and somehow you think we can help.” When saying <b>we</b> shegestured to her Mother and herself. “I can only guess now that it hassomething to do with the spy.” At the word “spy” Regina’s Mother’s mouthdropped open.</p><p>“You can keep a secret can’t you?” the Queen said. “Didn’t even tellyour Mother did you?” The Queen chuckled.</p><p>“You told me not to speak of it to anyone.” Regina replied as if thatexplanation should not have been needed.</p><p>“Indeed I did, and you were trustworthy as usual. Your logic and yourobservations commend you. It is because of that that I have come to askyou, and your Mother, for a favor to the realm.” At this Regina smiled,and her Mother frowned, and the Queen understood and approved bothresponses.</p><p>With a glance at Mr. Goldthread the Queen continued. “I cannot share thedetails, but there is indeed a spy. I, on behalf of our country, amengaged in some delicate constructions and negotiations, and should theyfail it could bring great hardship upon us all, perhaps even a threat ofwar. It is in my efforts to avoid just such possibilities that I alwayslabor and battle against foreign schemers who think they can take ourserenity for their own.</p><p>“Well that is a story for another time, perhaps, but for now it isenough to know that the exposure of my plans would put our land in aposition of great difficulty and could be used to extort us or confoundus in our labors to preserve our peace. We must know who the spy is, whothey work for, and what is that they know!” The Queen paused a moment tocalm herself. From the tension in her voice the whole room knew thatwhat the Queen was sharing was most important.</p><p>“This is where you have already helped me ’Gina. After our lastencounter I was most frustrated with my children. As close as we are toyou, how is it that they could have let slip this gravest of secrets?And then I understood; it is because they are children. Children oftensee as we do not. They may miss what we intend, and infer what we donot. They sense emotionally what is important, but they may notcomprehend what it means. So, they know a lot, but they do not alwaysknow what is they know. But usually, at least for Royal offspring, thatknowledge stays bottled up. First in the Nursery, and then in theHousehold, until such time that the child becomes an adult and can bereleased to the Realm to keep his own counsel upon state matters. And soshould my secret have stayed bottled up except for you ’Gina.” Shepointed directly at the young girl, and as she did so Regina’s Motherstood up and stepped between the Queen and ’Gina, and simultaneouslyfelt on her elbow the secure grasp of one Swiss Guard.</p><p>“Please Madam” said the Queen to Regina’s Mother. “It was not anaccusation, but a compliment. Your daughter knows better than mychildren how to keep a secret. It is a skill she must have learned fromyou and her years downstairs, but she also knows or has been gifted witha sympathy that encourages others to trust her, and so they speak andshare. Even if they do not, the accuatance of her wit makes her a mightyinference engine. She can diagnose from a gait. She can deduce that ofwhich the children do not literally speak.</p><p>“It is not my children alone that know secrets they do not appreciate assuch, and I do not feel it is only my children who might be the conduitsto great knowledge that would leak out in conversation with, andobservation by, you my Dear. Are you willing to undertake a service foryour country?”</p><p>Regina did not have time to reply, before her Mother interjected. “Youwill speak to me first on such matters Your Highness.” Though the wordswere deferential, the attitude was not, and Regina’s Mother stood tallerdespite the strong arm on her elbow, and she edged herself more directlybetween the Queen and her daughter.</p><p>The Queen turned to the Regina’s Mother. “I would like to send her toschool.”</p><p>“To school?”</p><p>“To school. But not just to any school. There is in the city aresidential school. It is quite recognized for the excellence of itsinstruction. It is where my children should go if I were anyone but theQueen. Many children from the most respected families move there to liveand learn, and they do learn, becoming scientists, and advisors. It isthe Alma Mater of our Mr. Goldthread in fact. It is also …” and theQueen shifted slightly in her seat emphasizing the critical nature ofthe next point, “the school that almost all the children from thevarious embassies, consulates, and ambassadorial residences attend. Itis in sum a collection of the children from the households that have themost incentive, and the greatest capacity, to spy and undermine my rule.And it is from Regina that I have learned that such children leaksecrets. We have been unable to catch the spy, but we have been able todetect the loss of critical information. I am quite frankly at a lossfor how to proceed. With the assistance of Regina’s sensitive ear andintelligence I might gain information that would allow me, indirectly,to identify the source of this deceit.”</p><p>“The loss of this secret, ’Mum, it could mean war?” Regina’s Motherasked.</p><p>“Yes. It could mean war.”</p><p>“And that makes it a secret worth dying for and killing for.” Two simplestatements made by Regina’s Mother. Their implication was clear.</p><p>The Queen made no reply, she made no denial. Regina’s Mother continued.“I love my country, but I love my daughter more. You have a large andglorious family, and you have…” here ’Gina’s Mother gestured with aswing of her free hand, “all this. And all I have is this.” She restedher hand on Regina’s shoulder, who reached up to squeeze her Mother’shand..</p><p>The Queen stood. With a gesture to the guard she had him release hishold on Regina’s Mother’s elbow. The Queen came forward and stood faceto face, eye to eye with Regina’s Mother. “I do have a large family, butlately I feel it has grown. I feel as protective of your child now as Ido my own. But my family is larger still than can be measured bychildren or cousins or great-great aunts. It is the land and all itspeople. You think of your daughter and what could happen to her if shesucceeds in learning of the spy and their secrets. I think what happensif she fails. I think of the misery that will befall this land, and myextended family, the people for which I am ever and eternallyresponsible.” In the background Regina saw Albrecht’s face grow grim.“Think not dear Mother of this child only, but join me in thinking ofall the children.”</p><p>“I can do it Mother. I know I can. Let me try. Please!”</p><p>Regina’s Mother squeezed her child’s shoulder tighter, and looked up atthe ceiling in blind thought. It was a gesture that would have made allsmile under other circumstances. It was apparent to all that this wasthe same exact stance Regina took in moments of deep reflection, andneither Mother nor daughter could have denied the other.</p><p>“May I tell you a story your Majesty?” It was a surprising question, andthe Queen was surprised, but having met the daughter she thought theremight be more to the Mother than she had previously supposed. The Queenassented with a slight nod, and Regina could see Albrecht grow confusedand concentrate behind her.</p><p>“I have only ’ad one ’oliday in my life ’Mum. Me Dad saved for it forten years. Each tuppence extra, and some weeks there was none, went intoa jar that he kept under a board, in the floor, under the blanket uponwhich he slept. My sister and me shared a bed, and my Mother was only amemory that he told us about. She died when we were born. When my sisterand me were 15 the jar was full enough that we could go spend twoweekdays in the country. Weekdays was cheaper. My Dad, he wanted my sisand me to know something other than work. He told us so. He said workwould be our lot for ever after, and hardship (and my Sis and me couldtell he was thinkin’ of our Mom) disappointment, loss and sorrows. Butfor two days, two days of memories we would always ’ave, he wanted us toknow a time of bein’ carefree.</p><p>“Well, he was no outdoors-man. Mostly worked in the fields and sometimesin the greenhouse. He was good wit’ plants and things and we always atehealthy ’cause he could pluck us a dinner when we needed one, but hewasn’t much of a man for activities. Still he wanted us to know whatpuntin’ was, and he dident want me and Sissy to have to share all ourmemories so he wanted to punt us each in our own, what you call them,canoes.</p><p>“He pushed off in one and then reached over with the stick thing to getanother, and it started to drift away.” Regina could see the confusionand impatience growing on Albrecht’s face, but a slight hint of warmthand a smile on Mr. Goldthread’s. “So he reaches over with his foot tograb it. Then he wobbles a moment and the foot comes down firmer like,and now he is standing with the rod balancing while he’s got one foot inone canoe, and the other foot in the other canoe, and a realconcentrated look on his face. He managed to stay that way strugglingwith his legs to pull them together for almost two ’hole minutes, thenthey just went their separate ways and he got a duckin’. We all laughed.The water twernt deep. He just stood up, but I always remember thatmoment of leisure and delight when I am feelin worried.”</p><p>“But the point of the story is this. What you would be doin to my babygirl with your school; it wouldn’t be a duckin’ she was going to get.”</p><p>Regina saw Albrecht mouth the word “what?”, but the Queen kept hersympathetic expression. “But what would you have me do about it? We areof two worlds.”</p><p>“I know your Majesty.” Regina’s Mother continued. Regina was proud ofthe calm in her Mother’s voice, and her confidence in her argument. Shefelt sure Mr. Goldthread would have given her Mother’s chair a tap if hehad been standing behind her, and if she had been sitting down.</p><p>“But you aren’t making it so she can move in two worlds. You are makingher stuck in no world! She isn’t in either and she is going to have onefoot stuck in one, and t’other in t’other, and she’s goin to splitapar’! I will only give my okay to go to this school if you will keepher in that school until her education is done proper.”</p><p>“But what about Monsieur Franz? I thought he was tutoring your daughteras he does my children? Has he not been taking those responsibilitiesseriously?”</p><p>“Oh. He’s fine. He’s got Regina talking foreign, and measuring angles,but that’s not the education she needs to get both feet in the newboat!”</p><p>Albrecht could not contain his confusion. “Mother. What are we talkingabout?”</p><p>The Queen turned to her son with a smile. “Perhaps it is because you arestill too young, or because you have never been a parent. What Regina’smother is worried about is that all the exposure to our teas, and ourconversation has made Regina ill equipped to return happily to adownstairs role. But all the tutoring in French and Euclid will not suither for an upstairs role where the important knowledge is more ofmanners and gestures, and knowing who knows whom, and how they willreact to seeing Lady Whosit seated next to the Earl of Somewhere atSunday service. Regina can navigate the unspoken downstairs’ worldbecause she has been educated in its unspoken regulations, but she doesnot know, and will never learn from Monsieur Franz our upstairs culture,and so you and your brothers and sisters and me, and especially Mr.Goldthread have forcibly uprooted one foot from its secure place in thepunt and placed it insecurely in another. Regina’s mother wants us togive that foot some stability. She wants us to provide the furthereducation in mores that will enable Regina to stand in either punt, ineither world, stand on her own two feet if you will, in the boat of herchoosing. Isn’t that it Dear?”</p><p>“Yes ’Mum.” and Regina’s Mother gave a small bow here.</p><p>“You realize when you ask this that this is a <b>residential</b> school? Shewould have to live there. Coming home only on holidays and forvacations? That it will <b>change</b> her in ways neither of us can trulyforesee. She may never be able to stand on both feet in the downstairsagain?”</p><p>“Don’ you think I know that? Don’ you think I know what it will cost me?But isn’t it the best I can do for my girl?” And here Regina’s mother’stone grew loud, almost angry, and Regina worried how the Queen wouldrespond.</p><p>“I did not know all that. But now I do. And I think there is much morein common between the Mother and the Daughter than I had heretoforerecognized. Come here my Dear. Let us share a worried embrace.” And nowAlbrecht’s mouth opened again in surprise as he watched his Mother, theQueen, move forward and embrace Regina’s teary mother who hugged herback with one arm while shaking Regina’s shoulder with the other.“You’re going to help the Queen, and you’re going to help your country,and you’re goin to get an education my sweet. You’re going to get aneducation!” she repeated. Then Regina stood and they all three huggedeach other.</p></root><a href="chapter5.html">Prior Chapter Duty</a><p><a href="chapter7.html">Next Chapter Service</a></p></body></html>
