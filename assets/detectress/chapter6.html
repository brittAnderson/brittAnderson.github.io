It was early and cold. Few lamps were lit, and even<br/>a thin layer of dust could be found on some of the polished surfaces. It<br/>was not a room that had been meant for a meeting today. Neither the<br/>Queen nor her staff would have been satisfied with these conditions.<br/>’Gina looked across at her Mother sitting in the chair next to her. Her<br/>Mother seemed very nervous, and sat so rigid and so far forward on the<br/>edge of her chair that ’Gina was unsure if the chair was actually<br/>supporting her Mother at all or if her Mother was just hovering in the<br/>air in a squat.</p><p>’Gina’s Mother’s eyes toggled back and forth between the two men in the<br/>crisp black suits who had escorted them up from downstairs. They were<br/>two of Mr. Goldthread’s surrogates, his <b>gents</b> is how he referred to<br/>them. The Gents dressed as Mr. Goldthread did. They wore plain white<br/>shirts, black ties and shoes. From the breast pockets of their creased<br/>black suits emerged creased white handkerchief’s folded to reveal three<br/>points as sharp as pitchfork tines. Regina had noticed the only glimpse<br/>of color to be found upon them while going up the stairs. One of the<br/>Gents was in front and the other followed right behind. With each step<br/>the Gent in front of her took Regina saw flash a small embroidered<br/>square of red with a white cross set inside.</p><p>These men were neither of the upstairs nor downstairs. They lived in a<br/>big building by the stables where they kept to themselves and did their<br/>own meals and laundry. They were known, of course, to the staff, but<br/>they did not visit, and they did not chat. The Gents floated like black<br/>clad ghosts in the background of the Queen’s retinue, were seen to<br/>mingle in the crowd at public days, and would quietly swoop to bend<br/>their heads close to Mr. Goldthread’s in some whispered communication<br/>before silently taking their leave. Their quiet nature was so consistent<br/>that it was rumored by the stable boys (who in tending to the horses had<br/>the closest glimpses) that some of them might even be mute. While they<br/>were men of many races, they still managed in most ways to look alike.<br/>They wore their hair cut close, kept faces shaved, and most had flat,<br/>broken noses. All of them bore muscles that strained the seams of their<br/>tailored restraints.</p><p>Word had been sent that Mr. Goldthread needed a gent or two to escort<br/>the <b>ladies</b> - he was pointed in his use of this term - to this room at<br/>this time. And because they were <b>ladies</b> the agents were respectful and<br/>deferential in their requests, but because they were Mr. Goldthread’s<br/>men they were also insistent, and they did not say why or where Regina<br/>and her Mother were being taken.</p><p>Regina’s Mother, looking once more to her right, once more to her left,<br/>eyed the ebony trunks that stood watchful to each side. She leaned in<br/>towards Regina and whispered: “What’s doing little one?” And Regina<br/>could only shake her head a little from side to side in ignorance. She<br/>too glanced from right to left. Forgetting her fear, it being edged out<br/>by her curiosity, she had an idea that rapidly became too big for her<br/>head. To release the pressure she opened the valve that was her voice.</p><p>“They’re Swiss Mother!” Regina then immediately began to wonder why? Why<br/>Swiss men as Mr. Goldthread’s ’gents? Regina gazed up and faraway to let<br/>her thoughts grind on. Then another thought bubble burst. “Swiss Guards.<br/>Just like the Pope!”</p><p>Neither of the men flinched, but one turned his head ever so slightly to<br/>look at Regina. It was only due to her long practice with Mr. Goldthread<br/>that she felt sure she detected a smile. Her Mother saw nothing but<br/>their vigilant gazes. “Oh! Oh!” Regina could not stop the momentum of<br/>her thought, “The Queen is worried for herself…” and looking from side<br/>to side again at each of Goldthread’s gents, “and for us too?”</p><p>“Really?” her Mother asked. “Why should Her Majesty be worried for a<br/>maid and her daughter?” Her Mother’s effort to console herself and her<br/>daughter was not persuasive. This attempt to dismiss the seriousness of<br/>the gathering was refuted by its very nature: an escort of Swiss Guards<br/>taking place in the Queen’s tea room before dusting time. She and Regina<br/>became quiet again, and returned to their quiet waiting. Goldthread’s<br/>gents kept up their quiet watching.</p><p>Five minutes later the Queen entered followed by Mr. Goldthread. Both<br/>guards stood to attention, and both Regina and her Mother stood and<br/>bowed. “My Dears,” the Queen spoke, “Please be seated.”</p><p>At a wave of her arm a chair appeared, and the Queen sat down across<br/>from Regina and her Mother. “Where is Albrecht?” the Queen asked the<br/>’gent to Regina’s right. He answered with a stony Goldthread glare.<br/>“Well I don’t care.” she replied, “Fetch him!” Then to Regina and her<br/>Mother, “Another moment, please.”</p><p>A short moment later Albrecht appeared with his night shirt tucked into<br/>the pants of his regimental uniform. He had one boot on, and the other<br/>in his hand. He hopped in. His hair pointed to heaven and flopped with<br/>each leap forwarded as he tried to walk and put on his other boot at the<br/>same time. Seeing the scene before him he became at once professional.<br/>Dropping the boot he too stood to attention. “Good Morning Mother,” he<br/>said.</p><p>“Good Morning Albrecht,” she replied, “Now,” she said focusing on ’Gina.<br/>“ What do you observe about me?”</p><p>“Well. First, your gout is better. You walked in quite briskly.”</p><p>“Yes my gout is better. And I have you to thank for that. I consulted<br/>with Cook, who you told me had the same affliction, and she recommended<br/>a remarkable poultice she gets from some village woman. Cook is also<br/>going to be cooking me some simpler meals, and I suspect that will help<br/>her gout more than mine since she seems to consume more in tasting her<br/>preparations than I in their eating.” And here the Queen smiled, “What<br/>else child?” Her gaze narrowed in a concentrated study of the young<br/>girl.</p><p>Regina reflected before speaking. She looked back at the Queen and then<br/>around at each of the other occupants of the room. Then for a moment she<br/>turned her head towards the ceiling. She seemed not to see it. Returning<br/>to a level gaze, ’Gina said, “You are worried. For yourself, and for<br/>your household, and somehow you think we can help.” When saying <b>we</b> she<br/>gestured to her Mother and herself. “I can only guess now that it has<br/>something to do with the spy.” At the word “spy” Regina’s Mother’s mouth<br/>dropped open.</p><p>“You can keep a secret can’t you?” the Queen said. “Didn’t even tell<br/>your Mother did you?” The Queen chuckled.</p><p>“You told me not to speak of it to anyone.” Regina replied as if that<br/>explanation should not have been needed.</p><p>“Indeed I did, and you were trustworthy as usual. Your logic and your<br/>observations commend you. It is because of that that I have come to ask<br/>you, and your Mother, for a favor to the realm.” At this Regina smiled,<br/>and her Mother frowned, and the Queen understood and approved both<br/>responses.</p><p>With a glance at Mr. Goldthread the Queen continued. “I cannot share the<br/>details, but there is indeed a spy. I, on behalf of our country, am<br/>engaged in some delicate constructions and negotiations, and should they<br/>fail it could bring great hardship upon us all, perhaps even a threat of<br/>war. It is in my efforts to avoid just such possibilities that I always<br/>labor and battle against foreign schemers who think they can take our<br/>serenity for their own.</p><p>“Well that is a story for another time, perhaps, but for now it is<br/>enough to know that the exposure of my plans would put our land in a<br/>position of great difficulty and could be used to extort us or confound<br/>us in our labors to preserve our peace. We must know who the spy is, who<br/>they work for, and what is that they know!” The Queen paused a moment to<br/>calm herself. From the tension in her voice the whole room knew that<br/>what the Queen was sharing was most important.</p><p>“This is where you have already helped me ’Gina. After our last<br/>encounter I was most frustrated with my children. As close as we are to<br/>you, how is it that they could have let slip this gravest of secrets?<br/>And then I understood; it is because they are children. Children often<br/>see as we do not. They may miss what we intend, and infer what we do<br/>not. They sense emotionally what is important, but they may not<br/>comprehend what it means. So, they know a lot, but they do not always<br/>know what is they know. But usually, at least for Royal offspring, that<br/>knowledge stays bottled up. First in the Nursery, and then in the<br/>Household, until such time that the child becomes an adult and can be<br/>released to the Realm to keep his own counsel upon state matters. And so<br/>should my secret have stayed bottled up except for you ’Gina.” She<br/>pointed directly at the young girl, and as she did so Regina’s Mother<br/>stood up and stepped between the Queen and ’Gina, and simultaneously<br/>felt on her elbow the secure grasp of one Swiss Guard.</p><p>“Please Madam” said the Queen to Regina’s Mother. “It was not an<br/>accusation, but a compliment. Your daughter knows better than my<br/>children how to keep a secret. It is a skill she must have learned from<br/>you and her years downstairs, but she also knows or has been gifted with<br/>a sympathy that encourages others to trust her, and so they speak and<br/>share. Even if they do not, the accuatance of her wit makes her a mighty<br/>inference engine. She can diagnose from a gait. She can deduce that of<br/>which the children do not literally speak.</p><p>“It is not my children alone that know secrets they do not appreciate as<br/>such, and I do not feel it is only my children who might be the conduits<br/>to great knowledge that would leak out in conversation with, and<br/>observation by, you my Dear. Are you willing to undertake a service for<br/>your country?”</p><p>Regina did not have time to reply, before her Mother interjected. “You<br/>will speak to me first on such matters Your Highness.” Though the words<br/>were deferential, the attitude was not, and Regina’s Mother stood taller<br/>despite the strong arm on her elbow, and she edged herself more directly<br/>between the Queen and her daughter.</p><p>The Queen turned to the Regina’s Mother. “I would like to send her to<br/>school.”</p><p>“To school?”</p><p>“To school. But not just to any school. There is in the city a<br/>residential school. It is quite recognized for the excellence of its<br/>instruction. It is where my children should go if I were anyone but the<br/>Queen. Many children from the most respected families move there to live<br/>and learn, and they do learn, becoming scientists, and advisors. It is<br/>the Alma Mater of our Mr. Goldthread in fact. It is also …” and the<br/>Queen shifted slightly in her seat emphasizing the critical nature of<br/>the next point, “the school that almost all the children from the<br/>various embassies, consulates, and ambassadorial residences attend. It<br/>is in sum a collection of the children from the households that have the<br/>most incentive, and the greatest capacity, to spy and undermine my rule.<br/>And it is from Regina that I have learned that such children leak<br/>secrets. We have been unable to catch the spy, but we have been able to<br/>detect the loss of critical information. I am quite frankly at a loss<br/>for how to proceed. With the assistance of Regina’s sensitive ear and<br/>intelligence I might gain information that would allow me, indirectly,<br/>to identify the source of this deceit.”</p><p>“The loss of this secret, ’Mum, it could mean war?” Regina’s Mother<br/>asked.</p><p>“Yes. It could mean war.”</p><p>“And that makes it a secret worth dying for and killing for.” Two simple<br/>statements made by Regina’s Mother. Their implication was clear.</p><p>The Queen made no reply, she made no denial. Regina’s Mother continued.<br/>“I love my country, but I love my daughter more. You have a large and<br/>glorious family, and you have…” here ’Gina’s Mother gestured with a<br/>swing of her free hand, “all this. And all I have is this.” She rested<br/>her hand on Regina’s shoulder, who reached up to squeeze her Mother’s<br/>hand..</p><p>The Queen stood. With a gesture to the guard she had him release his<br/>hold on Regina’s Mother’s elbow. The Queen came forward and stood face<br/>to face, eye to eye with Regina’s Mother. “I do have a large family, but<br/>lately I feel it has grown. I feel as protective of your child now as I<br/>do my own. But my family is larger still than can be measured by<br/>children or cousins or great-great aunts. It is the land and all its<br/>people. You think of your daughter and what could happen to her if she<br/>succeeds in learning of the spy and their secrets. I think what happens<br/>if she fails. I think of the misery that will befall this land, and my<br/>extended family, the people for which I am ever and eternally<br/>responsible.” In the background Regina saw Albrecht’s face grow grim.<br/>“Think not dear Mother of this child only, but join me in thinking of<br/>all the children.”</p><p>“I can do it Mother. I know I can. Let me try. Please!”</p><p>Regina’s Mother squeezed her child’s shoulder tighter, and looked up at<br/>the ceiling in blind thought. It was a gesture that would have made all<br/>smile under other circumstances. It was apparent to all that this was<br/>the same exact stance Regina took in moments of deep reflection, and<br/>neither Mother nor daughter could have denied the other.</p><p>“May I tell you a story your Majesty?” It was a surprising question, and<br/>the Queen was surprised, but having met the daughter she thought there<br/>might be more to the Mother than she had previously supposed. The Queen<br/>assented with a slight nod, and Regina could see Albrecht grow confused<br/>and concentrate behind her.</p><p>“I have only ’ad one ’oliday in my life ’Mum. Me Dad saved for it for<br/>ten years. Each tuppence extra, and some weeks there was none, went into<br/>a jar that he kept under a board, in the floor, under the blanket upon<br/>which he slept. My sister and me shared a bed, and my Mother was only a<br/>memory that he told us about. She died when we were born. When my sister<br/>and me were 15 the jar was full enough that we could go spend two<br/>weekdays in the country. Weekdays was cheaper. My Dad, he wanted my sis<br/>and me to know something other than work. He told us so. He said work<br/>would be our lot for ever after, and hardship (and my Sis and me could<br/>tell he was thinkin’ of our Mom) disappointment, loss and sorrows. But<br/>for two days, two days of memories we would always ’ave, he wanted us to<br/>know a time of bein’ carefree.</p><p>“Well, he was no outdoors-man. Mostly worked in the fields and sometimes<br/>in the greenhouse. He was good wit’ plants and things and we always ate<br/>healthy ’cause he could pluck us a dinner when we needed one, but he<br/>wasn’t much of a man for activities. Still he wanted us to know what<br/>puntin’ was, and he dident want me and Sissy to have to share all our<br/>memories so he wanted to punt us each in our own, what you call them,<br/>canoes.</p><p>“He pushed off in one and then reached over with the stick thing to get<br/>another, and it started to drift away.” Regina could see the confusion<br/>and impatience growing on Albrecht’s face, but a slight hint of warmth<br/>and a smile on Mr. Goldthread’s. “So he reaches over with his foot to<br/>grab it. Then he wobbles a moment and the foot comes down firmer like,<br/>and now he is standing with the rod balancing while he’s got one foot in<br/>one canoe, and the other foot in the other canoe, and a real<br/>concentrated look on his face. He managed to stay that way struggling<br/>with his legs to pull them together for almost two ’hole minutes, then<br/>they just went their separate ways and he got a duckin’. We all laughed.<br/>The water twernt deep. He just stood up, but I always remember that<br/>moment of leisure and delight when I am feelin worried.”</p><p>“But the point of the story is this. What you would be doin to my baby<br/>girl with your school; it wouldn’t be a duckin’ she was going to get.”</p><p>Regina saw Albrecht mouth the word “what?”, but the Queen kept her<br/>sympathetic expression. “But what would you have me do about it? We are<br/>of two worlds.”</p><p>“I know your Majesty.” Regina’s Mother continued. Regina was proud of<br/>the calm in her Mother’s voice, and her confidence in her argument. She<br/>felt sure Mr. Goldthread would have given her Mother’s chair a tap if he<br/>had been standing behind her, and if she had been sitting down.</p><p>“But you aren’t making it so she can move in two worlds. You are making<br/>her stuck in no world! She isn’t in either and she is going to have one<br/>foot stuck in one, and t’other in t’other, and she’s goin to split<br/>apar’! I will only give my okay to go to this school if you will keep<br/>her in that school until her education is done proper.”</p><p>“But what about Monsieur Franz? I thought he was tutoring your daughter<br/>as he does my children? Has he not been taking those responsibilities<br/>seriously?”</p><p>“Oh. He’s fine. He’s got Regina talking foreign, and measuring angles,<br/>but that’s not the education she needs to get both feet in the new<br/>boat!”</p><p>Albrecht could not contain his confusion. “Mother. What are we talking<br/>about?”</p><p>The Queen turned to her son with a smile. “Perhaps it is because you are<br/>still too young, or because you have never been a parent. What Regina’s<br/>mother is worried about is that all the exposure to our teas, and our<br/>conversation has made Regina ill equipped to return happily to a<br/>downstairs role. But all the tutoring in French and Euclid will not suit<br/>her for an upstairs role where the important knowledge is more of<br/>manners and gestures, and knowing who knows whom, and how they will<br/>react to seeing Lady Whosit seated next to the Earl of Somewhere at<br/>Sunday service. Regina can navigate the unspoken downstairs’ world<br/>because she has been educated in its unspoken regulations, but she does<br/>not know, and will never learn from Monsieur Franz our upstairs culture,<br/>and so you and your brothers and sisters and me, and especially Mr.<br/>Goldthread have forcibly uprooted one foot from its secure place in the<br/>punt and placed it insecurely in another. Regina’s mother wants us to<br/>give that foot some stability. She wants us to provide the further<br/>education in mores that will enable Regina to stand in either punt, in<br/>either world, stand on her own two feet if you will, in the boat of her<br/>choosing. Isn’t that it Dear?”</p><p>“Yes ’Mum.” and Regina’s Mother gave a small bow here.</p><p>“You realize when you ask this that this is a <b>residential</b> school? She<br/>would have to live there. Coming home only on holidays and for<br/>vacations? That it will <b>change</b> her in ways neither of us can truly<br/>foresee. She may never be able to stand on both feet in the downstairs<br/>again?”</p><p>“Don’ you think I know that? Don’ you think I know what it will cost me?<br/>But isn’t it the best I can do for my girl?” And here Regina’s mother’s<br/>tone grew loud, almost angry, and Regina worried how the Queen would<br/>respond.</p><p>“I did not know all that. But now I do. And I think there is much more<br/>in common between the Mother and the Daughter than I had heretofore<br/>recognized. Come here my Dear. Let us share a worried embrace.” And now<br/>Albrecht’s mouth opened again in surprise as he watched his Mother, the<br/>Queen, move forward and embrace Regina’s teary mother who hugged her<br/>back with one arm while shaking Regina’s shoulder with the other.<br/>“You’re going to help the Queen, and you’re going to help your country,<br/>and you’re goin to get an education my sweet. You’re going to get an<br/>education!” she repeated. Then Regina stood and they all three hugged<br/>each other.</p></root><a href="chapter5.html">Prior Chapter Duty</a><p><a href="chapter7.html">Next Chapter Service</a></p></body></html>
