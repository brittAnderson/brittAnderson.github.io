Their security was paramount. It had beendecided that if word got out about ’Gina’s role then her life might bethreatened too. This did not surprise nor worry ’Gina or her mother.They felt secure in the servants’ nook in the castle, but they did notprotest when a French speaking Swiss Guard they had never seen before,but who was vouched for by the local commandant, appeared one morningand told them to come with him now and with only the clothes they werewearing.</p><p>They were escorted that first night to a safe house. The clothes theyhad worn, their only connection to the castle and their former life,were abandoned. ’Gina’s finger wound was properly dressed and her motherwas supplied with proper materials for its care. The next night theywere at an Inn. In their room were more clothes and two small travelingsuitcases. In ’Gina’s suitcase was a set of books including a smallintroductory calculus text with selected exercises indicated in theunmistakable hand of Monsieur Franz. There were also two passports: onefor a Mrs Isabella Pine and the other for her daughter Leah. They wereapparently the widow and daughter of a moderately well to-do merchantand were mourning his death by taking a Cooke’s tour of the continent.Their itinerary and carriage tickets took them first, by a ratherindirect route, to the village of Beatenberg in Canton Bern inSwitzerland. There they were expected at the Gasthaus Falkon owned by aHerr and Frau Gafner. At first ’Gina and her mother simply rested. Thenthey learned to enjoy the mountains on long hikes guided by Herr Gafnerwho regaled them with the childhood tales of young Hans. After a coupleof weeks ’Gina and her Mother were moved at night to the next stop oftheir disappearance.</p><p>At the Pension Stoll, in the small village of Stein-am-Rhine, ’Gina, orrather Leah as she was now called, took walks with her mother. Theywould track down one side of the river, ride across on a ferry if theyfound one, and walk back along the other bank. If no ferry came theysimply walked back the way they came keeping time by the local churchbells. ’Gina and her mother visited the local monks who made wine at themonastery in town. Some days they stayed in and Leah worked away at thecalculus of that infuriating Herr Leibniz. ’Gina’s French and Germanimproved during these days, though the only dialect she managed to pickup was apparently not deemed appropriate for a young lady. <b>Chabis</b>.</p><p>A winter was passed in this peaceful village, and then abruptly one dayanother anonymous messenger came wearing the same red socks with thesmall white cross. He had the tickets, he said, “that they had ordered.”</p><p>“Had we ordered tickets?” Mrs. Pine asked her daughter with a smile?“And if so did ’Gina know where they were going?”</p><p>The train took them to Zürich. At the Hauptbahnhof they were met by agnomic Swiss man with a broad accent who insisted speaking German tothem though his comprehension of the mother’s and daughter’sconversation revealed that he spoke English perfectly well. He had, hetold them <b>auf Deutsch</b>, been appointed by their travel agency as theirattaché and representative. ’Gina and her mother tried to suppress theirsurprise at hearing they had a travel agency and an attaché. He had beenled to understand, so he said, that they expected to be in the city forsome time, so that the young lady could complete her preparatory studiesin anticipation of attending the University in a few years. He had takenthe initiative of finding them a small apartment in an attractive areaof the lower village, the Niederdorf.</p><p>Mrs. Pine and Leah were taken by tram and then led on foot through thesmall winding medieval lanes of the Niderdorf to a stone building with ahalf timbered front near the Grossmünster. Their apartment had a smallparlor, kitchen, and one bedroom. It was the largest space they had everbeen able to call their own.</p><p>In the apartment they found the schedule of classes with a local tutorfor which Leah had been enrolled. The receipt for the tuition payment,informed Leah that she was on a scholarship, and congratulations by theway. Their attaché informed them of the address of the bank where themonthly stipend from Mrs. Pine’s estate was to be deposited. He thentold them they should feel free to contact him with any questions. Then,having given them neither his name nor his contact information, he leftnever to be seen again.</p><p>The Pines, Leah and Isabella, ’Gina and her mother, settled into theirnew and unexpected life. Days passed peacefully and pleasantly. Leahwent to class and her mother tended home. Leah’s mother pursued her ownstudy of German, and tried, unsuccessfully, to befriend the neighbors.Left mostly to themselves, the two took many walks about the town. Theirfavorite discovery was a small elevated plaza across the river fromtheir apartment. It was near an old church. From the <b>Platz</b> one couldlook across the river to the other side of town and see in the distancethe Polyterrase of the university that Leah hoped to attend. Leah wouldsit on a bench near the edge of the <b>Platz</b> with her books spread outupon the parapet. She would study and gaze in alternation. Her Motherwould knit or crochet, or, more recently, after several weeks ofattentive observation, play chess against the men on the large outdoorset with the large wooden pieces. Mrs. Pine could beat some of the menand was gradually coming to be accepted as one of the regulars. Theyreferred to as Frau Schatzmeisterin.</p><p>On this day Leah was supposed to be learning line integrals. Despite herbest efforts she felt herself being pulled back into the horrors of theyear before. ’Gina felt her breathing quicken. The anxiety attacks hadbeen quite frequent early on, but she had not felt one so strongly forsome weeks now. ’Gina wondered what could have provoked her panic now.Then she became conscious of what must have been the stimulus. A cloakedfigure with a limp was crossing the plaza towards her. She casuallystuck her pen in her hair and then unsheathed the blades of her snakebracelet. With the other hand she leaned back to confirm the presence ofher throwing knife in her boot. She began to feel there was somethingfamiliar about the face underneath the shroud. Despite the limp therewas something reassuring about the man’s gait and carriage. Then she sawthe boots, and for a moment she hoped. Then she began to doubt.</p><p>Slowly, and without any quick or threatening moves, the figureapproached. He came to face her, and sat on the low wall that dividedthe plaza from the steep descending hillside and the houses below. Twohands came up and slowly pulled back the cloak’s hood.</p><p>“Al…!” then quietly “Albrecht!” ’Gina hissed with glee. “Your here!Your leg! What happened.”</p><p>He smiled. “It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance again Miss Pine.”He purposefully looked slowly both right and left to signal to ’Ginathat they could not be sure that they were not being watched.</p><p>“Good day to you too Sir,” she said with the sunniest of smiles. Andthen quietly, “Tell me of Her Majesty and your family.”</p><p>Albrecht replied in <b>sotto voce</b>, “They are all well thanks to you. TheQueen, and I, owe you a debt that we will never be able to repay.”</p><p>“And Jimmie?”</p><p>“We never found him, but we did catch up with Miss Bostick,” and hereAlbrecht reflexively glanced at his right leg and patted it. “She was adanger, but is no longer a threat. Nor will she ever be again.”</p><p>“What about the sugar? Who did that? Did Jimmie do it before he left?Was that the job for those other men? Or was there someone else in thehousehold? I worry about that.”</p><p>“So does my Mother, the Queen. We simply do not know Miss Pine. And thatis why my Mother still has need of you. She has allowed me to come andtell you that when you have finished your education, as she promisedyour Mother you would do, and not a moment sooner, the Queen wishes youto return. The Queen feels a great need for your intelligence andloyalty. She has made a unique position just for you. She wishes toappoint you the Queen’s Own Detectress.”</p></root><a href="chapter17.html">Prior Chapter Another Tea</a></body></html>
