Their security was paramount. It had been<br/>decided that if word got out about ’Gina’s role then her life might be<br/>threatened too. This did not surprise nor worry ’Gina or her mother.<br/>They felt secure in the servants’ nook in the castle, but they did not<br/>protest when a French speaking Swiss Guard they had never seen before,<br/>but who was vouched for by the local commandant, appeared one morning<br/>and told them to come with him now and with only the clothes they were<br/>wearing.</p><p>They were escorted that first night to a safe house. The clothes they<br/>had worn, their only connection to the castle and their former life,<br/>were abandoned. ’Gina’s finger wound was properly dressed and her mother<br/>was supplied with proper materials for its care. The next night they<br/>were at an Inn. In their room were more clothes and two small traveling<br/>suitcases. In ’Gina’s suitcase was a set of books including a small<br/>introductory calculus text with selected exercises indicated in the<br/>unmistakable hand of Monsieur Franz. There were also two passports: one<br/>for a Mrs Isabella Pine and the other for her daughter Leah. They were<br/>apparently the widow and daughter of a moderately well to-do merchant<br/>and were mourning his death by taking a Cooke’s tour of the continent.<br/>Their itinerary and carriage tickets took them first, by a rather<br/>indirect route, to the village of Beatenberg in Canton Bern in<br/>Switzerland. There they were expected at the Gasthaus Falkon owned by a<br/>Herr and Frau Gafner. At first ’Gina and her mother simply rested. Then<br/>they learned to enjoy the mountains on long hikes guided by Herr Gafner<br/>who regaled them with the childhood tales of young Hans. After a couple<br/>of weeks ’Gina and her Mother were moved at night to the next stop of<br/>their disappearance.</p><p>At the Pension Stoll, in the small village of Stein-am-Rhine, ’Gina, or<br/>rather Leah as she was now called, took walks with her mother. They<br/>would track down one side of the river, ride across on a ferry if they<br/>found one, and walk back along the other bank. If no ferry came they<br/>simply walked back the way they came keeping time by the local church<br/>bells. ’Gina and her mother visited the local monks who made wine at the<br/>monastery in town. Some days they stayed in and Leah worked away at the<br/>calculus of that infuriating Herr Leibniz. ’Gina’s French and German<br/>improved during these days, though the only dialect she managed to pick<br/>up was apparently not deemed appropriate for a young lady. <b>Chabis</b>.</p><p>A winter was passed in this peaceful village, and then abruptly one day<br/>another anonymous messenger came wearing the same red socks with the<br/>small white cross. He had the tickets, he said, “that they had ordered.”</p><p>“Had we ordered tickets?” Mrs. Pine asked her daughter with a smile?<br/>“And if so did ’Gina know where they were going?”</p><p>The train took them to Zürich. At the Hauptbahnhof they were met by a<br/>gnomic Swiss man with a broad accent who insisted speaking German to<br/>them though his comprehension of the mother’s and daughter’s<br/>conversation revealed that he spoke English perfectly well. He had, he<br/>told them <b>auf Deutsch</b>, been appointed by their travel agency as their<br/>attaché and representative. ’Gina and her mother tried to suppress their<br/>surprise at hearing they had a travel agency and an attaché. He had been<br/>led to understand, so he said, that they expected to be in the city for<br/>some time, so that the young lady could complete her preparatory studies<br/>in anticipation of attending the University in a few years. He had taken<br/>the initiative of finding them a small apartment in an attractive area<br/>of the lower village, the Niederdorf.</p><p>Mrs. Pine and Leah were taken by tram and then led on foot through the<br/>small winding medieval lanes of the Niderdorf to a stone building with a<br/>half timbered front near the Grossmünster. Their apartment had a small<br/>parlor, kitchen, and one bedroom. It was the largest space they had ever<br/>been able to call their own.</p><p>In the apartment they found the schedule of classes with a local tutor<br/>for which Leah had been enrolled. The receipt for the tuition payment,<br/>informed Leah that she was on a scholarship, and congratulations by the<br/>way. Their attaché informed them of the address of the bank where the<br/>monthly stipend from Mrs. Pine’s estate was to be deposited. He then<br/>told them they should feel free to contact him with any questions. Then,<br/>having given them neither his name nor his contact information, he left<br/>never to be seen again.</p><p>The Pines, Leah and Isabella, ’Gina and her mother, settled into their<br/>new and unexpected life. Days passed peacefully and pleasantly. Leah<br/>went to class and her mother tended home. Leah’s mother pursued her own<br/>study of German, and tried, unsuccessfully, to befriend the neighbors.<br/>Left mostly to themselves, the two took many walks about the town. Their<br/>favorite discovery was a small elevated plaza across the river from<br/>their apartment. It was near an old church. From the <b>Platz</b> one could<br/>look across the river to the other side of town and see in the distance<br/>the Polyterrase of the university that Leah hoped to attend. Leah would<br/>sit on a bench near the edge of the <b>Platz</b> with her books spread out<br/>upon the parapet. She would study and gaze in alternation. Her Mother<br/>would knit or crochet, or, more recently, after several weeks of<br/>attentive observation, play chess against the men on the large outdoor<br/>set with the large wooden pieces. Mrs. Pine could beat some of the men<br/>and was gradually coming to be accepted as one of the regulars. They<br/>referred to as Frau Schatzmeisterin.</p><p>On this day Leah was supposed to be learning line integrals. Despite her<br/>best efforts she felt herself being pulled back into the horrors of the<br/>year before. ’Gina felt her breathing quicken. The anxiety attacks had<br/>been quite frequent early on, but she had not felt one so strongly for<br/>some weeks now. ’Gina wondered what could have provoked her panic now.<br/>Then she became conscious of what must have been the stimulus. A cloaked<br/>figure with a limp was crossing the plaza towards her. She casually<br/>stuck her pen in her hair and then unsheathed the blades of her snake<br/>bracelet. With the other hand she leaned back to confirm the presence of<br/>her throwing knife in her boot. She began to feel there was something<br/>familiar about the face underneath the shroud. Despite the limp there<br/>was something reassuring about the man’s gait and carriage. Then she saw<br/>the boots, and for a moment she hoped. Then she began to doubt.</p><p>Slowly, and without any quick or threatening moves, the figure<br/>approached. He came to face her, and sat on the low wall that divided<br/>the plaza from the steep descending hillside and the houses below. Two<br/>hands came up and slowly pulled back the cloak’s hood.</p><p>“Al…!” then quietly “Albrecht!” ’Gina hissed with glee. “Your here!<br/>Your leg! What happened.”</p><p>He smiled. “It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance again Miss Pine.”<br/>He purposefully looked slowly both right and left to signal to ’Gina<br/>that they could not be sure that they were not being watched.</p><p>“Good day to you too Sir,” she said with the sunniest of smiles. And<br/>then quietly, “Tell me of Her Majesty and your family.”</p><p>Albrecht replied in <b>sotto voce</b>, “They are all well thanks to you. The<br/>Queen, and I, owe you a debt that we will never be able to repay.”</p><p>“And Jimmie?”</p><p>“We never found him, but we did catch up with Miss Bostick,” and here<br/>Albrecht reflexively glanced at his right leg and patted it. “She was a<br/>danger, but is no longer a threat. Nor will she ever be again.”</p><p>“What about the sugar? Who did that? Did Jimmie do it before he left?<br/>Was that the job for those other men? Or was there someone else in the<br/>household? I worry about that.”</p><p>“So does my Mother, the Queen. We simply do not know Miss Pine. And that<br/>is why my Mother still has need of you. She has allowed me to come and<br/>tell you that when you have finished your education, as she promised<br/>your Mother you would do, and not a moment sooner, the Queen wishes you<br/>to return. The Queen feels a great need for your intelligence and<br/>loyalty. She has made a unique position just for you. She wishes to<br/>appoint you the Queen’s Own Detectress.”</p></root><a href="chapter17.html">Prior Chapter Another Tea</a></body></html>
