Their lives were threatened. Their security was paramount. It had been decided that if word got out about ’Gina’s role then her life might be threatened too. This did not surprise nor worry ’Gina or her mother. They felt secure in the servants’ nook in the castle, but they did not protest when a French speaking Swiss Guard they had never seen before, but who was vouched for by the local commandant, appeared one morning and told them to come with him now and with only the clothes they were wearing.</p><p>They were escorted that first night to a safe house. The clothes they had worn, their only connection to the castle and their former life, were abandoned. ’Gina’s finger wound was properly dressed and her mother was supplied with proper materials for its care. The next night they were at an Inn. In their room were more clothes and two small traveling suitcases. In ’Gina’s suitcase was a set of books including a small introductory calculus text with selected exercises indicated in the unmistakable hand of Monsieur Franz. There were also two passports: one for a Mrs Isabella Pine and the other for her daughter Leah. They were apparently the widow and daughter of a moderately well to-do merchant and were mourning his death by taking a Cooke’s tour of the continent. Their itinerary and carriage tickets took them first, by a rather indirect route, to the village of Beatenberg in Canton Bern in Switzerland. There they were expected at the Gasthaus Falkon owned by a Herr and Frau Gafner. At first ’Gina and her mother simply rested. Then they learned to enjoy the mountains on long hikes guided by Herr Gafner who regaled them with the childhood tales of young Hans. After a couple of weeks ’Gina and her Mother were moved at night to the next stop of their disappearance.</p><p>At the Pension Stoll, in the small village of Stein-am-Rhine, ’Gina, or rather Leah as she was now called, took walks with her mother. They would track down one side of the river, ride across on a ferry if they found one, and walk back along the other bank. If no ferry came they simply walked back the way they came keeping time by the local church bells. ’Gina and her mother visited the local monks who made wine at the monastery in town. Some days they stayed in and Leah worked away at the calculus of that infuriating Herr Leibniz. ’Gina’s French and German improved during these days, though the only dialect she managed to pick up was apparently not deemed appropriate for a young lady. <b>Chabis</b>.</p><p>A winter was passed in this peaceful village, and then abruptly one day another anonymous messenger came wearing the same red socks with the small white cross. He had the tickets, he said, “that they had ordered.”</p><p>“Had we ordered tickets?” Mrs. Pine asked her daughter with a smile? “And if so did ’Gina know where they were going?”</p><p>The train took them to Zürich. At the Hauptbahnhof they were met by a gnomic Swiss man with a broad accent who insisted speaking German to them though his comprehension of the mother’s and daughter’s conversation revealed that he spoke English perfectly well. He had, he told them <b>auf Deutsch</b>, been appointed by their travel agency as their attaché and representative. ’Gina and her mother tried to suppress their surprise at hearing they had a travel agency and an attaché. He had been led to understand, so he said, that they expected to be in the city for some time, so that the young lady could complete her preparatory studies in anticipation of attending the University in a few years. He had taken the initiative of finding them a small apartment in an attractive area of the lower village, the Niederdorf.</p><p>Mrs. Pine and Leah were taken by tram and then led on foot through the small winding medieval lanes of the Niderdorf to a stone building with a half timbered front near the Grossmünster. Their apartment had a small parlor, kitchen, and one bedroom. It was the largest space they had ever been able to call their own.</p><p>In the apartment they found the schedule of classes with a local tutor for which Leah had been enrolled. The receipt for the tuition payment, informed Leah that she was on a scholarship, and congratulations by the way. Their attaché informed them of the address of the bank where the monthly stipend from Mrs. Pine’s estate was to be deposited. He then told them they should feel free to contact him with any questions. Then, having given them neither his name nor his contact information, he left never to be seen again.</p><p>The Pines, Leah and Isabella, ’Gina and her mother, settled into their new and unexpected life. Days passed peacefully and pleasantly. Leah went to class and her mother tended home. Leah’s mother pursued her own study of German, and tried, unsuccessfully, to befriend the neighbors. Left mostly to themselves, the two took many walks about the town. Their favorite discovery was a small elevated plaza across the river from their apartment. It was near an old church. From the <b>Platz</b> one could look across the river to the other side of town and see in the distance the Polyterrase of the university that Leah hoped to attend. Leah would sit on a bench near the edge of the <b>Platz</b> with her books spread out upon the parapet. She would study and gaze in alternation. Her Mother would knit or crochet, or, more recently, after several weeks of attentive observation, play chess against the men on the large outdoor set with the large wooden pieces. Mrs. Pine could beat some of the men and was gradually coming to be accepted as one of the regulars. They referred to as Frau Schatzmeisterin.</p><p>On this day Leah was supposed to be learning line integrals. Despite her best efforts she felt herself being pulled back into the horrors of the year before. ’Gina felt her breathing quicken. The anxiety attacks had been quite frequent early on, but she had not felt one so strongly for some weeks now. ’Gina wondered what could have provoked her panic now. Then she became conscious of what must have been the stimulus. A cloaked figure with a limp was crossing the plaza towards her. She casually stuck her pen in her hair and then unsheathed the blades of her snake bracelet. With the other hand she leaned back to confirm the presence of her throwing knife in her boot. She began to feel there was something familiar about the face underneath the shroud. Despite the limp there was something reassuring about the man’s gait and carriage. Then she saw the boots, and for a moment she hoped. Then she began to doubt.</p><p>Slowly, and without any quick or threatening moves, the figure approached. He came to face her, and sat on the low wall that divided the plaza from the steep descending hillside and the houses below. Two hands came up and slowly pulled back the cloak’s hood.</p><p>“Al…!” then quietly “Albrecht!” ’Gina hissed with glee. “Your here! Your leg! What happened.”</p><p>He smiled. “It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance again Miss Pine.” He purposefully looked slowly both right and left to signal to ’Gina that they could not be sure that they were not being watched.</p><p>“Good day to you too Sir,” she said with the sunniest of smiles. And then quietly, “Tell me of Her Majesty and your family.”</p><p>Albrecht replied in <b>sotto voce</b>, “They are all well thanks to you. The Queen, and I, owe you a debt that we will never be able to repay.”</p><p>“And Jimmie?”</p><p>“We never found him, but we did catch up with Miss Bostick,” and here Albrecht reflexively glanced at his right leg and patted it. “She was a danger, but is no longer a threat. Nor will she ever be again.”</p><p>“What about the sugar? Who did that? Did Jimmie do it before he left? Was that the job for those other men? Or was there someone else in the household? I worry about that.”</p><p>“So does my Mother, the Queen. We simply do not know Miss Pine. And that is why my Mother still has need of you. She has allowed me to come and tell you that when you have finished your education, as she promised your Mother you would do, and not a moment sooner, the Queen wishes you to return. The Queen feels a great need for your intelligence and loyalty. She has made a unique position just for you. She wishes to appoint you the Queen’s Own Detectress.”</p></root><a href="chapter17.html">Prior Chapter Another Tea</a></body></html>
