She looked neither right norleft. She ascended stairs without attention. With her gaze up and to theright she was in a state of reflection. The knife scared her, but italso focused her. Her fear before had been diffuse, and therefore hadbeen distracting. Now her fear was pointed, and she knew who to fear:Jimmie.</p><p>Or did she? Had he tried to kill her or warn her? Had he mistaken herfor someone else? She thought he had recognized her, but maybe he hadrecognized her as someone else? ’Gina was sitting now at her vanity. Acandle burned on the table beside her. She caught her own gaze in themirror. She stared at her face.</p><p>Jimmie. He had “stolen her nose”, and pulled coins from her ears. He hadendless handkerchiefs in his cheeks, and could read Cook’s mind. He knewmore knock-knock jokes than there were days, and he had played with herwhen she was bored, the little, lonely girl in a household of busyservant folk. On days when carriage calls were not expected he wouldpolish the carriage brass and then, when no one was looking, he wouldshow her his “circus knife.” And he taught her how to hold it and tothrow it. How could he not have recognized her? She looked again in themirror. Was she so different? No. Her hair was clean and brushed, andher clothes were pretty silk, but she was what she had always been, theservant’s daughter: Regina. Jimmie could not mistake her.</p><p>Could it have been a warning? The Swiss Guard carried knives, but theirswere different. She had seen Hans’ and Rene’s. Theirs were not circusblades. Not so flat nor large. It was not a Swiss Guard knife. For allthe time she had observed the men there was not one time when she hadseen any of the Guards speak to Jimmie, and they were a close crew. Theywould not have had a member in the Queen’s household and not haveacknowledged that man unless… No. There was no unless. He could nothave been a guard.</p><p>Jimmie was a spy. When you admitted it to yourself, it was so obvious. Afriendly, flirtatious footman who spent his time loitering around theservants’ kitchen gossiping with the maids. He was someone that everyoneloved to see. He told knock-knock jokes to children, pinched the cheeksof maiden maids, and told bawdy stories of his roust-about days to theblack suited men over gin on Sunday afternoons. Everyone spoke toJimmie, and Jimmie spoke to everyone. The staff always described hisgift of gab, but as ’Gina thought more about the conversations she hadheard she remembered how, while they had always begun with a Jimmiestory, they always ended with the others trying to match him and top himwith stories of their own. Those that did not have his life of adventurefrequently met the challenge by reciting household gossip of upstairslife. Visitors and parties. Comings and goings. With a bit of deductiona person could learn a lot about the Queen’s plans fromcross-referencing the servants sightings.</p><p>The dinner. The interruption. The Ambassador’s abrupt panic. The Queenhad been to town just a few streets away. Jimmie must have visited theembassy and some important warning had been relayed to the Ambassador’sears. Jimmie could pass along his secrets. Whenever the carriage came totown Jimmie came to town. When the Queen or her agents traveled on herbehalf Jimmie was there to observe and report. An overnight stay at somecousin’s castle gave an opportunity for meeting people and filingreports. The more ’Gina reflected, the more she saw that Jimmie was thespy. The more convinced she became that Jimmie was the spy, the more sheknew this meant that Jimmie knew who she was. He obviously had not knownshe was at the Andalonian ambassador’s residence. He had been toosurprised for that, but he knew where she was now, and he could easilyguess why. And even if he was wrong or uncertain, the fact she was in anAndalonian carriage with a Kaiserkönig crest could not lead him to anyinnocent conclusions.</p><p>The Andalonian carriage. The smile and the wink at Diego. He had been tothe Andalonian embassy several times. It was the Andalonians! Jimmy waspassing his information to the Andalonians. The Ambassador was ambitiousand patriotic and opportunistic. He was spying on the Queen, and Jimmiewas his agent. Or something like that. Was it the whole family? Diego?Helene?</p><p>Probably not Diego. At least not knowingly. He had been too ready totalk of Jimmie and their relation, but then he also stole her lettersfor the head mistress. It was no longer possible to explain that asjealousy or paranoia on the part of Miss Bostick. Diego had been giveninstructions and Miss Bostick must somehow be connected with the plot.And what a connection she would be. Head Mistress of a school for allthe rich, royal, and diplomatic children of the capitol. A place fromwhich to watch, and pry, and spy, and put together pieces. Who wasfriends with whom? Which families vacationed together? Just as Jimmiecould listen to the Castle gossip, so could Miss Bostick listen to theschool’s. And like jigsaw puzzle masters they could put the piecestogether and see a greater picture. Were they together or two separatethreads of Andalonian intrigue?</p><p>While ’Gina was eventually to layout her conclusions in this clear andlinear way, it had been the work of hours of surmises and deductions.Retreats and re-calculations. She heard the church bells tolling three,and she did not know what to do. How was she to alert the Queen?</p><p>Perhaps she could just leave. Walk the way to the castle keeping low andwithin a few hours she could be home again and tell her story. She roseand stretched, and walked to gaze out the window at the moon lit streetbelow. She saw a shadow waver. A man was in the gap where Willie hadbeen. A match flared and lit a stranger’s face. Coincidence? Thenanother stranger came, dark clad, cap low, trailing smoke from hiscigarette. The first man gestured without looking towards her window,then towards the entrance way below. The second put his hand upon theshoulder of the first and patted. The first man nodded and walked awaydown the street and the second slid into the alcove and for a fewminutes more ’Gina observed the intermittent glow of the cigarette tipas it brightened with each breath.</p><p>She returned to sit at her desk and dropped her face into her hands. Forawhile she sobbed deeply, and then she slammed a fist upon the table.There still must be a way. She began to think.</p><p>Listening to the church bells strike four she paused with that upwardgaze of concentration that the Queen had noticed and which she sharedwith her mother. Than she hurriedly reached for pen and stationary andbegan to write.</p><p>When the letter was addressed and sealed she went once again to thewindow, and stared down at the empty moon lit street and the darkalcove. There was no sign of anyone. Perhaps she had been too nervous.Too young. Too suspicious. Too scared by two men on the way home fromthe pub asking each other for a light. Then she detected movement, and afigure jogged along the pavement. It slowed and walked the last fewsteps to the dark alcove where a man now appeared. Even from thisdistance, and in the dark, she recognized the jogging man as Jimmie. Forone thing he was still in his footman’s livery. He was in conversationwith the first man when ’Gina decided she could wait no longer.</p><p>She could not mail the letter from the school. It would be waylaid byDiego, or the Head Mistress, and even if they deemed it innocent thereis no reason to suspect that they would post it on without delay. Thereshould not be a delay. The Queen must know about the spies.</p><p>At this juncture, deep in thought, ’Gina heard the slight rap on herdoor, then watched it open and closed and saw the tear stained face ofher friend Helene.</p><p>“Janus? What is going on? Our house is in a frenzy, and my Father iscursing you. I have runaway. I don’t understand!”</p><p>’Gina looked at the girl, she seemed younger now, eyes puffy, cheeksshiny and moist with tears. ’Gina felt older. Helene was a paradox.Could ’Gina trust her? Was Helene her only ally, this daughter of herenemy? Or just another clever manipulation?</p><p>Candle light lit the room and the two girls stared until ’Gina made herdecision and spoke.</p><p>“I need you to mail this letter.”</p><p>Helene looked confused, “What? I don’t understand. I don’t understand.What is going on? What has happened? Tell me Janus. I thought we werefriends. I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Helene! Listen! If you are my friend, and I truly need one, you will dowhat I ask without understanding. I need you to mail this letter now.Now!” She yelled at teary-eyed, confused Helene.</p><p>Helene came closer. Spoke quietly. “I don’t understand.”</p><p>“There isn’t time to understand. You only need to understand if you aremy friend.”</p><p>“I am your friend Janus, but why do you need me to mail a letter in themiddle of the night. Why do I have to do it? Just drop it in the slot inthe hall.”</p><p>“Because people want to kill me.”</p><p>Helene’s eyes opened wide, and her mouth drooped open too. ’Gina guessedthat poor Helene thought this had something to do with her being aKaiserkönig. While ’Gina felt bad to deceiving her friend, there was notime for explanations now. “Do you trust me Helene? Can I trust you?Will you risk all for a friend?” A true statement, but a manipulation.’Gina did not enjoy the deceit, but was moved by her desperation.</p><p>Helene responded, “I would risk all for you friend,” at which ’Ginakissed her on the cheek, and wiped at her own sour tears. “Take thisletter,” ’Gina said. “And go to a letterbox as far away from school asyou can get before dawn; where no one will see you post it. Drop it inand hurry back.”</p><p>As ’Gina spoke this last, Helene had already begun to turn around withthe letter pressed tight in her hands. ’Gina gave her one more, brief,hug, and watched as Helene cracked the door, spied along the hallway inboth directions, and then slid out into the black hall, and disappeared.</p><p>Alone in her dimly lit room, and shadowed by dark thoughts, ’Gina lockedthe door. ’Gina snuffed the candle and all became black. ’Gina could seea faint light at the window from the setting moon. She hurried over tothe window. Standing to the side, ’Gina saw the two shadowy men arguing.Then Jimmie slapped the man hard, and both figures froze. She watchedthe first one retreat to his alcove, and Jimmie began to cross thestreet towards the entrance to the school. Half way across the street hewas met by a figure coming out of the school. It was the Head Mistress,still in her bed clothes; with only a coat over her shoulders. Therewere hurried words between the Head Mistress and Jimmie. ’Gina could notmake out what was said. Then the Head Mistress and Jimmie both turnedtowards the school.</p><p>’Gina exhaled one large sob in her first panic. He was coming for her.Jimmie was coming for her. The sign. The sign. They said someone wouldbe watching for her. She raced across to her bed sheet and using thesheers from her sewing kit she cut one long white strip and then tore itin two. She used a hair pin to stick one end of one of the strips in onecorner of her window, and then used a second hair pin to stick the otherend in the cross corner making one half of her rescue sign in thewindow. ’Gina reached for the other strip when she heard the stepsoutside her door. “May we come in Regina?” And she heard Jimmie laugh.When he discovered the door was locked he cursed.</p><p>Regina did not know what to do. They would kill her, she felt certain ofthat, but would they also make her talk? She would she tell them of theQueen, and Hans, and all the plans? She did not want to die, but morethan that she did not want to fail the Queen. ’Gina wanted to beat thesepeople. ’Gina knew they would just use her as one more puzzle piece intheir plot to torment her Queen: the mother of her friends Albrecht andMietzie; the leader of her land; and the woman who ever worried how toprotect the people of her realm. ’Gina would not let down her Queen.’Gina heard a crash upon the door, and more swearing. Another crash andthe hinges began to give. Another crash. Heavier. The Head Mistress andJimmie together were throwing themselves at the door. ’Gina saw the tophinge begin to pull from the jam. ’Gina looked about in a hurry, but notin panic. She was now alone in thought and purpose. She saw at once thematchbox on her vanity. She tore it open and poured the cubes into herhand. Six came out, but she managed to hold on to only two. When thenext crash came two bodies cascaded to the floor. ’Gina brought hand tomouth and sucked both cubes in. She felt the sweetness rest on herteeth. She stood facing the angry faces of Miss Bostick and Jimmie.</p><p>“Tell us girl! What have you done? What have you told the Queen.”</p><p>’Gina stood silent. Not because she was afraid to answer, but becausethe cubes had not yet dissolved and she was afraid to let them see.</p><p>Jimmie slapped her hard, and ’Gina worked to keep her mouth shut. It wasworking. When she looked again both figures had become wavy.</p><p>“Dammit Girl. No games. Our heads are in play. What have you told theQueen?”</p><p>Jimmie grabbed her hand and laid it on the vanity. He held it by thewrist and with his other hand brought out a knife, a bigger one than theone he threw, and held it over the end of her little finger. Then helooked at her with a questioning air. His gaze met hers. When she saidnothing he cut down in a quick movement that severed the tip of herfinger. The tip fell to the floor, and was followed by a small stream ofred. ’Gina did not feel the pain she expected. She did not feel much ofanything. Her perception was of a slowed down version of events, as ifshe were watching a play. It replayed. The tip of her finger detached.It fell to the carpet. Then all that ’Gina sensed was darkness andsilence.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The girl melted in Jimmie’s arms and he let her drop to the floor whereshe fell upon her severed finger tip.</p><p>“What have you done!” Miss Bostick screamed at him.</p><p>With his anger at Regina’s fainting, his perceived failure, and MissBostick’s scolding, he struck back with his empty hand making a mightyslap across the Head Mistress’s face. The sound of the slap seemed toabsorb all other sounds, and the two stared at each other. Jimmie sawblood at the corner of Miss Bostick’s lip, and nodded at her. “You’reright. That one weren’t deserved nor fairly signaled. You are owed one.”</p><p>Miss Bostick reached back and with her open right hand and swung as hardas she could. She connected with his face. Immediately her hand printappeared as a pink blotch on his white cheek. Shortly thereafter a smalltrickle of blood ran down from a cut in his lip. The two stared at eachother. Then, without a sign, they leaned in and kissed.</p><p>Pulling back Miss Bostick asked, “Is she dead?”</p><p>“No. Can’t be.” replied Jimmie. “Not from losing a bit of her littlefinger. Must have fainted.”</p><p>“Well then pick her up, and let’s go.”</p><p>Jimmie sheathed his knife. Scooped up the little girl, swung her overhis shoulder, and followed Miss Bostick out of the room.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Helene was just about ready to leave the school when she heard movementon the steps. She stepped into a dark doorway and watched the HeadMistress fly by at a run her bed clothes streaming. Frozen by her fearof being expelled; Helene still had not quite come to believe theextremity of Janus’s claims, she stood there still when Miss Bostickreturned with Jimmie. Helene had seen this man. He visited the Embassyand did tricks, but now his face was a glower. Anger shone, and threat,and menace. Helene believed all Janus said now, but her fear was sogreat she could not move. Helene heard the pounding on Janus’s door, andthe screaming of the name Regian. Helene was scared by the threateningtone, and confused; who was Regina? Helene did not have time to puzzlethis out before she heard the first crash of Jimmie trying to force thedoor. Helene stepped out slightly from the shadows. She spied along thehall. While confusion remained, doubts were gone. Her friend was indanger. Her friend. The girl that had stuck up for her and Diego when noelse would. The only girl who would dare face Miss Bostick. That girl,that friend had given her a responsibility, a responsibility that mightbe of life and death importance. Helene shrunk back into the shadows.Then she heard the crack of wood splintering. Helene stepped out. Sheheard the next charge, louder, and the thunk and tumble of bodies on thefloor. Helene’s legs found life, and she raced toward the school’sentrance, and down its front steps.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Willie shivered and winced. Since the big men had come and taken hisviewing spot, Willie had been forced to watch ’Gina’s window from a lesscomfortable spot. The only other shielded location on the street thatWillie had been able to find was inside the doorway of a darkened home alittle further down the street. The big men came and went. Willie didnot feel he could move or shift his position for fear of giving himselfaway. He did not know who they were or why they were there. He reasonedthat if Albrecht had sent them, Albrecht would have told them about him.Since they did not seem to know about him, they didn’t come fromAlbrecht. To Willie that meant that they were not to be trusted.</p><p>Willie was so tired. He had been on the street almost constantly.Occasionally he had drunk from the fountain. One of the woman who livedon the street and had often seen him there took him for a foundling andoccasionally left him stale bread with a bit of cheese, only slightlymoldy. Willie was grateful for her generosity. He knew he would havebeen excused if he had gone to find food or to wash himself, but hecould not do it. He knew that what he was being asked to do wasimportant. He did not know what it was exactly, or why it was he who hadbeen tasked. But he would not let Albrecht down. He might not be asoldier like Albrecht, or a Swiss Guard like Hans, but that did not meanhe was worth less or that his duty did not matter. It was important, andit was his responsibility. Over the last weeks Willie had grown thinnerand dirtier watching Regina through her window. Only when he knew sheshould be in class did he allow himself a few hours sleep back at thestables where he would brush and walk Albrecht’s horse, and maybe have abite to eat from the stable master. But for the rest of the day he wasin one crack or another on Regina’s street staring at her window.</p><p>Willie heard the men arguing. Willie thought one of the voices soundedfamiliar, but he could not place it or understand what was said. There!What was that? The first half of an X was clearly swathed across ’Gina’swindow. What did that mean? Why did she stop? Was she in trouble or not?What was he supposed to do? He came out of his hiding place now and helooked down the street. The man from the alcove had stepped forward too.Willie and the big man looked at one another and then both looked backup at the window of Regina’s room. Shadows. Forms. He saw the shadowswhir and then Willie saw ’Gina’s head snap back. He heard a moment laterthe clear sound of the slap. Willie bounced on his toes. Was it an ’X’or not? What was he supposed to do?</p><p>The man from the alcove had come a couple of steps closer to Willie, buthe stopped at the sound of the slap and looked back up the window. Theyboth watched as ’Gina’s shadow slid out of view. Then the two, Willieand the alcove watcher, turned to look at each other. The man from thealcove shrugged.</p><p>At this moment, a small figure ran from the entrance of the school. Herlight colored clothing caught and reflected the moon light. The alcoveman took two quick steps in her direction, then redirected and racedinto the school building. Willie by reflex, not reflection, chased afterthe small running figure.</p><p>Willie was gaining on her quickly. He saw that she was smaller andyounger than he was. Willie was surprised. “Stop!” he shouted.</p><p>Helene looked over her shoulder. Someone was chasing her. She keptrunning.</p><p>Willie pushed her from behind, and Helene fell in a sprawl on the groundscraping her knees and hands, but never giving up her grip on theletter. “What are you doing? Why are you running? What do you know aboutthose people and Regina?” Willie shouted at her.</p><p>It was that name again. Regina. Helene assumed this boy must be with theother people since he called Janus by the same, strange name the othershad used. He must not get the letter. Helene ignored his question, andgot up to start running again. Helene made it only a couple of stepsbefore Willie pushed her down again. “Stay down.” he said. Willie sawher try to shield something, and he rolled her over to grab at what itwas she held in her hand. Helene scratched at his face, catching him onthe cheek. When Willie pulled back she got up again to run, and thistime Willie pushed her hard and she was thrown back against the wall ofthe house behind her. She dropped the letter. Helene was on her handsand knees gasping. Willie picked up the letter and looked at it. Hecould not read much, but he recognized the Kaiserkönig crest, and heknew, as every child knew from bedtime stories and soldier tales, thatthe Kaiserkönig line dreamed of overthrowing the Queen. Somehow thismust fit together. Somehow this must have something to do with thepeople who were threatening Regina. This must be one of the letters ofthe Kaiserkönigs to one of their spies or assassins. It had been an ’X’;just not a completed one, because Regina had been interrupted before shecould finish it. Distracted by his thoughts Willie failed to payattention to Helene. She leaped on him. She was scratching and clawing.She was trying desperately to get the letter back. Not out of malice,but only as a defensive maneuver, Willie ducked and pushed at herattacking figure. Helene lost her balance. She fell back striking theback of her head on the pavement. Willie heard her moan and saw herwrithe. He waited no longer, but ran for the stables holding the letterin his hand.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Willie took Albrecht’s steed from the stall, threw only a bit in itsmouth and mounted bareback. Willie wheeled the horse out of the stablesand clattered down the cobblestones at a trot. Once Willie reached thedirt track on the edge of town he pointed toward the castle. Willieassumed his jockey’s stance and whipped the horse with the reins untilit was at a full gallop. Each time the steed slowed Willie prodded iton. After five miles the steed begun to froth. It shook its head as ifin disappointment with itself. Another five minutes and the horsestumbled, but it did not fall. Willie wanted to ease off, but heremembered Albrecht’s words. Willie remembered his duty. He thoughtabout ’Gina and the desperate, clawing child running with a hiddenletter in the night. He continued to whip his unsteady mount. Faster.Faster. A few seconds later one of the horse’s legs buckled again. Bothhorse and rider went down. Willie had practiced falls, and he tucked androlled coming out of the crash with only bruises, but the horse waslamed. With barely a pause it rose and with a glance at Willie began totrot lamely toward the castle. Willie mounted it on the run crying; bighuge tears rolled down his cheeks. He resumed whipping the horse withthe reins. Willie yelled. “Damn you. Damn you. Damn you.” It was notclear who he was damning. “Why did you have to go and do that? Damn you.Damn me.” It was still not fast enough. The horse strained forward. Itdid not need the whip to goad it. It was a warrior’s horse. Williekicked with both heels, and the horse broke into a weird limping gallop.Both rider and mount knew it was not fast enough. It was not fastenough! Albrecht had told him the mission was more important than thehorse. Willie had always loved this horse, and he had grown to love itmore during this ride: its courage, its strength, its sacrifice, butAlbrecht had said… Duty demanded… Willie slapped the horse again.Willie kicked at the horse again. The horse sensed it needed to gofaster. It needed to go faster. And it did go faster. The horse trustedWillie. If Willie needed it to go faster, lame or not, the horse wouldgo faster. For five more minutes the horse galloped again, with only aslight limp. Then Willie heard the snap when one of the horse’s forelegsbroke. The horse went down head first propelling Willie forward. Williethrew himself to the side as thousands of pounds of exhausted beastcascaded past. Still the horse tried to rise. Tried to trot forward onits broken leg. Willie heard a second bone snap. The horse knew thatWillie needed it to go fast. It tried to rise again, but neither forelegmoved as it was supposed to. The horse skidded forward on its knees itspowerful hind legs pushing forward while it neighed in pain andfrustration. Willie screamed. Willie howled. Willie cried. And Willieran toward the castle. He could hear the frustrated, tortured whinnyinghorse fading behind him valiantly still trying to do its duty; to getits rider to the castle. Willie ran, and he ran.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>The police station in the school quarter was a generally slow and lazyassignment. Diplomats’ and Royals’ kids tended not to get into too muchtrouble, and when they did their parents covered it up. Also, theparents tended not to tolerate ne’er-do-wells in the neighborhood oftheir children, and so riff-raff were soon run out. Thus, finding ascraped, screaming, and inconsolable child lying on the streets near theschool at dawn was a bit of a novelty. The policeman had guessed at heridentity from his knowledge of the community. They station sent word tothe Andalonian Embassy.</p><p>About a half hour after the messenger had been dispatched the Ambassadorappeared at the station. “I believe you are holding my daughter. Whatare the charges?”</p><p>“Well, there aren’t exactly any charges Ambassador, but …”</p><p>“No charges? Well then release her at once.”</p><p>“Now Ambassador, we have to ask…”</p><p>Again the Ambassador interrupted. “What are the charges?”</p><p>“Well, Sir there are not any charges, but …”</p><p>The Ambassador erupted. “Well then. Have you kidnapped my child? If youhave no charges then release my daughter to me. Now. If you do not, Iwill be forced to file a diplomatic protest with the Queen’s LawEnforcement magistrate describing the illegal hostilities laid againstme and my poor child by your precinct.”</p><p>The Desk Sargent stared in disbelief at this speech. The man’s child hadbeen brought in screaming from the streets and her father was yelling athim for mistreatment. The Desk Sargent also knew that no one cared whathe thought when it came to diplomatic cases. Those people just didwhatever they wanted.</p><p>“As you wish Ambassador. Follow me please.” He led the Ambassador backinto the cells where little Helene laid rocking side to side. On hearingthe door to her cell unlocked, she looked around. Seeing her fatherenter she leaped up and said at once. “Oh Papa. Janus … ” but beforeshe could say another word he slapped her across the face and told herto shut up. Stunned, she obeyed, and the Desk Sargent looked away.</p><p>The Ambassador reached down and took her hand. “Let’s go,” he said.“Now.”</p><p>The Ambassador led Helene out the front of the police station. The DeskSargent followed them to the door, and watched them descend down thesteps to board a carriage with the Andalonian crest. The carriage wasloaded down with trunks and baskets, and trailing behind it a cart alsofilled with trunks and a few pieces of furniture. The Desk Sargentwatched the Ambassador pass his daughter into the cramped interior ofthe coach, after which he climbed up beside the coachman, who withoutfurther orders jerked the reins and the carriage moved off at a trot.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Mr. Goldthread was actually pacing, and it was making Regina’s mothervery nervous. The two Swiss Guards, René and Hans, looked at him, andlooked at each other. Mr. Goldthread caught their glances, and turnedwithout comment and left the room. Hans closed the door behind thedeparting Mr. Goldthread. The tension in the room eased slightly.Regina’s mother looked at the envelope and the letter in front of her.The letter that Willie brought had not been a note from spies, and apuzzled Albrecht immediately brought the note to Mr. Goldthread. It wasclear from Willie’s story that something bad was happening, but it wasnot at all clear what it was or what it meant. Albrecht had left Williecrying in his room where the night staff had brought him. Then Albrechthad gone in search of Mr. Goldthread. Mr. Goldthread had roused theguards, and awakened the Queen who sat in her war room ready to plan,but for what?</p><p>The letter Willie brought spoke of stationary.</p><p>Breakfast plans were halted. Regina’s mother was summoned. Regina’smother sat reading the letter that had been addressed to her by name,but with the title of Private Secretary of the Countess of Kaiserkönigand to a standard Kaiserkönig address. The letter was brief andessentially said that Janus had determined to have new stationaryproduced along a new modern pattern that she had observed in thecapitol. ’Gina, writing as Janus, had charged the Secretary to order her100 sheets. She wanted it produced along the lines of the hand-drawnmodel enclosed. And a hand-drawn model was enclosed. A thick sheet ofcreme colored hand pressed paper was enclosed. In it’s center, wherenormally the writing would go, all was blank. Mr. Goldthread and his menhad gone over this section of the letter repeatedly and thouroughly. Thepaper had been held up to the light. No message appeared. The page hadbeen held over steam. No message appeared. Various reagents of knowninvisible inks had been dripped upon its surface. No message appeared.</p><p>The page remained blank, or nearly blank; there was the hand-drawnexample of a border that was the model for the stationary to be ordered.It ran along the perimeter of the page. The decoration had been,presumably, the cover story for the message hidden in the center, butthere was no message there, or at least no message could be found. HadRegina not had time to finish her letter? Was it all some horriblemisunderstanding? Was Regina in danger or not? Was the Queen?</p><p>After Mr. Goldthread and the cryptanalysts of the Queen’s detachment ofSwiss Guards had spent two hours pouring over the letter and testing itwithout results it was shown to the Queen. She had sat in her war roomlooking at the envelope and pages.</p><p>“You have tested and studied the envelope and first page too Mr.Goldthread?”</p><p>“Yes we have Your Majesty, but if ’Gina had hidden the message there,there would have been no reason to include an additional page. Webelieve therefore, strongly, that that page has been included tocommunicate to us the message.”</p><p>The Queen continued to stare at the pages that lay before her. “Why doyou think Mr. Goldthread that rather than addressing this letter to herfake Aunt she chose to address it to her mother by name?”</p><p>“She wanted to make sure the post office contact saw it and brought ithere?” Mr. Goldthread said. The Queen raised her eyebrows. “No, YourMajesty, I do not like that explanation either, but I am afraid I havenothing better to offer.”</p><p>“Did you ever think Mr. Goldthread that she might have addressed it toher mother, because it was her mother she wanted to see it?”</p><p>“No Your Majesty. It had not.” And picking up the envelope, letter, andsample stationary, he turned and left the room bringing it down into theRegina’s study room off the kitchen pantry where Regina’s mother nowsat. And where, after depositing the pages, he had begun pacing until hereceived the dismissing look from the Swiss Guards.</p><p>Regina’s mother stared hard at the pages, and then leaned back sighing.“I don’t know what I am doing or what I am supposed to do. Is my girl indanger?”</p><p>The Swiss Guard René looked at her squarely. “We do not know for sure,but we believe it likely. The boy Willie’s story is confused, but itappears that she was making the signal for extraction when she wasstopped. Although he didn’t know it importance, Willie hurried thisletter on its way to us. It is our best hope at the moment for findingout what is happening. That is our best hope for helping Regina.”</p><p>And so Regina’s mother returned her gaze to the pages. She did not touchthem. She simply looked. Occasionally she would cock her head to oneside, and then it would straighten. The guards simply sat and watched.Once Mr. Goldthread knocked at the door and looked in. Hans shook hishead and Mr. Goldthread retired.</p><p>Regina’s mother fidgeted. Both guards looked up. She stood, and theystood up. Then she screamed. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know whatit says. I don’t know what it means. I am just staring and staring, butI don’t know what it means. I want my baby girl!” And she staredfiercely at the guard Hans.</p><p>Hans calmly walked over to Regina’s mother. He bent down a bit so hiseyes were on the same level as Regina’s mother’s eyes. “Your daughter isvery smart, no?”</p><p>“Yes, too smart.” Regina’s mother sighed.</p><p>“No,” Hans said. “The apple does not fall far from the tree.”</p><p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Smart daughters have smart mothers. You will figure it out. Calmyourself. Focus and be patient. It will come to you. Perhaps a cup oftea will help?”</p><p>Regina’s mother nodded. “Yes. Maybe. A cup of tea would be nice.” Sherubbed her eyes.</p><p>Hans nodded, and reached around with his hand groping for the littlerope that would ring the bell for the servant to bring tea.</p><p>“No,” Regina’s mother said, “We don’t have those here in the servant’squarters, you have to …” Hans began to walk to the door. “Stop!”Regina’s mother commanded.</p><p>Hans was disciplined. He froze. He and René watched Regina’s mother cockher head to the side and look up into the sky. They looked at eachother. An idea was coming. “Give me that sheet of paper.” Regina’smother ordered. “ No. The other one.” Hans dropped the letter and handedher the odd piece of sample stationary. Regina’s mother held it. Lookedat it. Rotated it, and seemed to be searching along the perimeter wherethere ran the series of small and large circles. “Come with me.” shesaid, and the two disciplined soldiers followed her as she ran down thehall into the servants’ area.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>Mietzie paced in her room. Since shortly before dawn guards had beenplaced in the wing of the royal residence. The children had beenquarantined to their rooms. Mietzie hated it. Why wouldn’t anyone tellthem anything? They were children, true, but not knowing was worse thanknowing. And alone. Mr. Goldthread said it was better if they were notconcentrated, and this was what they had practiced. Still. The littleones must be crazy with fear, and she herself was very nervous. What wasgoing on? Could this have anything to do with Regina?</p><p>Then Mietzie heard the bell in her room. It was the bell that only sheand Regina used for messaging. It began to ring. Short peel (.) Shortpeel (.) Short peel (.) Long peel (-) Long peel (-) Long peel (-) Shortpeel (.) Short peel (.) Short peel (.) And then it repeated all again.Mietzie looked at her door. Mietzie knew that outside guards stoodthere. They were under orders not to let her leave. With no hesitationMietzie walked over and pounded her fist on the button that opened thedoor for servant’s access. The two cats, Queenie and Chevalier, leapeddown from her bed, and when the door was opened wide enough, Mietziesqueezed through and began to sprint down the corridor with the two catstrailing right behind.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>In the bell room René, Hans, and Mr. Goldthread listened as Regina’smother repeatedly played an S-O-S on the bell for Mietzie’s room. Thenthey heard the slap of bare feet and there came running into the room,breathing hard, Mietzie followed by Chevalier and Queenie. “Regina!Where is she? She called me on the bells. She is in trouble.” Mietzieblurted out.</p><p>“It was me Princess,” Regina’s Mother said. “We don’t know where Reginais or what is going on. I think she sent a message in that code you twoused to use, but I can’t read it. Except for this emergency call.”Regina’s Mother thrust the stationary sheet at Mietzie while pointing tothe decorative edging. “There. What does it say?”</p><p>“I can’t read it,” Mietzie said, “I can only hear it.” She thrust thecard back at Regina’s mother. “Play more of it. Short bells littlecircles. Long bells big circles.” Hans took the card and held it so thatRegina’s mother could see, and Regina’s mother began to ring the bellwhile Mietzie intoned slowly “J-i-m-m-i-e s-p-y” Regina’s mother gaspedand stopped ringing. René immediately left the room and two more guardsappeared to take his place.</p><p>“More,” said Hans. Regina’s mother resumed her ringing. Mietzie said“A-n-d-a-l-o-n-i-a”</p><p>“That’s it. That’s the end of the loop.” Regina’s mother said.</p><p>The two new Swiss Guards turned an about face and left. Mr. Goldthreadstood in the door. “Andalonia,” he said “Order the borders sealed. Iwill go tell her Majesty.”</p><p>“No need. I am here.” And Mr. Goldthread turned around to see the Queenbehind him and Albrecht standing behind her. The Queen strode past Mr.Goldthread and gave Mietzie a tight bear hug. “Well done little one.Well done.” Then turning to Regina’s mother, “What a mistake we have allmade wasting your time and talents on cleaning. Brilliant. JustBrilliant. Well. How do we find Regina?”</p><p>Albrecht spoke up. “I have been talking to Willie. I think it likelythat Jimmie and the woman Head Mistress have her. I have sent word forthe school to be searched.”</p><p>“Andalonia?” the Queen asked turning towards Mr. Goldthread.</p><p>“I think not Your Majesty. It is quite likely that an Ambassador wouldpay for information, but kidnapping little girls would be more than theywould bargain for. I don’t think Jimmie will turn out to be anAndalonian spy, but rather a mercenary looking to sell information tothe highest bidder. In this case it was Andalonia. Andalonia willdisavow all knowledge of the agent. But there are probably moremalevolent forces backing Jimmie.”</p><p>“Well we will still expel that Ambassador!” the Queen said angrily.</p><p>“I would be very surprised if he had not already left your Majesty. TheAndalonians are not ethical, but they are clever, and given toself-preservation.”</p><p>The Queen harrumphed in response.</p><p>Mr. Goldthread continued. “In fact your Majesty, I think we will need torefrain from commenting officially on any these events when theAndalonians announce a replacement for ’health reasons’.”</p><p>The Queen glowered, but she did not dispute. “But what about Regina?”</p><p>“Albrecht,” Mr. Goldthread asked. “if you were a criminal abandoned byyour sponsor and trapped in the realm with one of her agents what wouldyou do?”</p><p>Albrecht looked at his mother when he said, “I would keep my prisoneralive to bargain, and then I would head for the one place where I knewthey would not cooperate with my Mother.”</p><p>When Mr. Goldthread nodded, the room intoned together “OstHinterlandia.”</p><p>There was silence. Albrecht looked at his Mother, the Queen. “Mother?”She met his stare, and then nodded, “But not alone boy. Not alone.”Albrecht nodded at her, raised an eyebrow at the Swiss Guard Hans, whosmiled in return, and then two spun on their heels and ran from theroom.</p></root><a href="chapter14.html">Prior Chapter Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner?</a><p><a href="chapter16.html">Next Chapter Flight</a></p></body></html>
