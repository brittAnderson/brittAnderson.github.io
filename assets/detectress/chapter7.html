Her status as a Queen’s agent had not affectedthe formality with which she was treated nor any apparent alteration inher downstairs status. Slowly the room filled with the Queen’s children.Polite chatter began. The little ones asked after ’Gina’s cat, Queenie,who they much preferred to the Mietzie’s fat and pampered one, and ’Ginatold them a short tale involving Cook and some disappearing fishfillets. Still the conversation did not flow as it usually did. Perhapsit was the absence of Albrecht and Mietzie that led to the different,less friendly feeling. Or it may only have been ’Gina who felt Mietzie’sand Albrecht’s absences as disapproving.</p><p>Shortly before the Queen was to appear, Mietzie entered with Albrechtproviding encouragement from behind (in a non-royal household it wouldhave been called “pushing“). Mietzie began to walk toward the chairfurthest from ’Gina, and it was only when Albrecht cleared his throatwith a noise like a cannon shot that Mietzie redirected course and tookthe one on ’Gina’s side. After a moment Mietzie leaned in and could beseen whispering into ’Gina’s ear with animation and emotion. After which’Gina gave a small, sad shake of her head. Mietzie made an audible“harrumph!” and staring straight at Albrecht got up and began to marchtoward an open chair on the opposite side of the tea circle. She waspointedly ignoring the hive like humming that was Albrecht’s repeated,loud, and ineffectual throat clearings.</p><p>It was into this syncopated contest of discontented grunting that theQueen made her entrance with Mr. Goldthread by her side. All grewsilent, and the children all stood, except for ’Gina who bowed with herhead held low. The Queen took in the situation with her glance, butignored it. “Sit Children, please.” With this invitation servantsappeared to pour the tea, and Albrecht exchanged a look and a shrug withhis Mother who slightly shook her head. The Queen initiatedconversations with questions, and all were answered politely, but noresponse led to further comments and the tea took the tenor of amagistrate’s inquiry.</p><p>The Queen was regal. She was cool, and contained. She sipped her tea ina relaxed and elegant fashion. She too inquired after Queenie (she toopreferred Queenie to Mietzie’s fat, spoiled Chevalier. In fact, otherthan Mietzie, it was only ‘Gina who liked Chevalier, and only ’Gina thatChevalier allowed to pick him up (besides Mietzie of course)). After theQueen had finished her cup of tea, taken a bite of a <b>petit four</b> andthen one taste of a cucumber sandwich ala Oscar Wilde, she felt that herobligation to appear unhurried, and unprovoked had been met. The Queensuggested an early end to today’s tea with the statement “There is stillmuch royal work to be done today children. Perhaps you will allow anearly adjournment?” Of course, one only assented to the Queen’s queries,but on this occasion the agreeing nods of the children were sincere. TheQueen stood and made eye contact with Albrecht who returned it withsomething approaching a glower. The Queen gave a slight nod, and aslighter sigh. “Mietzie, ’Gina. Remain a moment won’t you.” Then with alook over her shoulder she some how provoked Mr. Goldthread intoproducing the assorted nanny’s and tutors that supervised the remainingchildren to appear and fetch their charges away. Albrecht too remained,and the Queen noted this, but said nothing.</p><p>“Please sit. Children,” the Queen said. Albrecht remained standing tothe side while Mietzie and ’Gina each sat in their places at the fararcs of the tea circle seating.</p><p>The Queen looked at Albrecht, who gave a nod toward Mietzie. The Queenglanced at her daughter, but then turned and spoke first to ’Gina. “Youdo keep your secrets, don’t you,” and then with a bit of annoyancecreeping in, “And what is going on with you Mietzie?”</p><p>“She’s keeping secrets from me. I ordered her to tell me. And she has todo what I order because I am a Princess and she is… She is … Well!You need to punish her!”</p><p>“Punishing ’Gina is not the first thing that comes to mind,” the Queenreplied icily, “You are the one in need of lessons I am afraid. And…”she paused, continuing with a calmer voice, “but the responsibility ismine. You do as I do. You spoil your cat, because I spoil you. You feelentitled, because I have taught you to feel entitled. I have made yourbrother see the responsibilities that come with his privileges, but Ishare with you only the expectations of obedience, never the obligationto serve.”</p><p>“To serve? You never serve.” Mietzie replied. ’Gina squirmed. She wasnot used to, and was made uncomfortable by, seeing this family squabble.She had the thought to excuse herself, when the clairvoyant Mr.Goldthread stilled her motion before it began with a light tapping ofhis knee on her chair.</p><p>“I only serve!” the Queen boomed. “I serve my family. I serve in myposition. I serve my country. You serve only yourself.”</p><p>“Mother.” Albrecht said.</p><p>The Queen quickly turned on him, but on seeing him relaxed her knottedshoulders, and smiled. “You are the better part of both your Father andme.” then turning to Mietzie. “Mietzie. ’Gina has done what I commanded.I told her something, and bade her not repeat it, and that she has done.You could have used a bit more of your deductive talents, which I knowyou to have, and pondered why ’Gina was not obeying your order? First,why would a <b>commoner</b> deny you, but more importantly why would yourfriend not confide in you? Having thought on that you would haverecognized there was more to understand, even if you could not determinewhat it was. Here is today’s lesson: respond to your confusion withreflection rather than reflex. And here is today’s advice: friends forroyals are few and far between, do not take them lightly.” Then turningback to Albrecht she asked, “Well?”</p><p>“Tell her Mother, I think. It will make ’Gina’s life easier to not haveMietzie feuding with her at this point. She can use her friend back too,I think, and it just might help Mietzie learn your lesson. I thinkMietzie might do better if you gave her more opportunities todemonstrate it.”</p><p>Mietzie stood up straighter, and looked at her brother appreciatively.It was true, she thought, she did want to do things. It was just thatthere wasn’t much for her to do, but get dressed, go to lessons, teas,parties, military ceremonies, music lessons, riding parties, and visitsto distant cousins who spoke guttural tongues, and slurped their tea.</p><p>“I have assigner her a … mission.” the Queen announced.</p><p>Mietzie looked straight at ’Gina and immediately flushed red with anger.Her mouth opened in preparation to protest, but then her better naturemade her pause, and she thought about Mother’s reflex and reflect. Whywould her Mother give ’Gina a mission and not her? Why could no onespeak of it? Why must no one know about it, even her and her siblings?And as long as she was wondering at things new and unexplained, why washer Mother staying up so late, and appearing so fatigued and tired, andwhy had she stopped eating breakfast, and why had her meetings with Mr.Goldthread and her other advisers lengthened?</p><p>Mietzie spoke again. Calmly. “It’s important, and…” she paused inthought again and then the connection sparked, “it’s dangerous!” Thenreflex overrode reflection and Mietzie ran to ’Gina and hugged her. “Youcan do it.” she said. “You’re so clever, and honorable. I know you cando it. Whatever it is. What is it Mother? Let me help Mother. Please?”</p><p>And then even though no one had seen or heard any movement, the Queenasked, “Well Goldthread. Out with it. I can see you’re about to burstwanting to say something.”</p><p>Mr. Goldthread replied in his consistent, sonorous and calm voice. “Ibelieve Prince Albrecht has a suggestion.”</p><p>“I do?” Albrecht looked deeply puzzled.</p><p>“I believe you do Sir,” Mr. Goldthread continued. “I distinctly rememberyou remarking that the status of Regina’s impersonation would besignificantly enhanced by having at least one servant permanentlyresident with her.”</p><p>“Well, I did say that, and I think it’s true, but I do not see what thathas to do with … OH!” and then more speaking to himself than theothers, “Mietzie? Really? Well why not? It could be a good learningexperience for Mietzie.” then, louder, to the others. “Yes, Why not?Mietzie could go as ’Gina’s servant.”</p><p>“Really? That’s quite impossible. She would be immediately recog…” theQueen broke off, and made eye contact with Mr. Goldthread. “Yes, onreflection.” with a nod to Mietzie, “maybe it could work after all. YesAlbrecht, maybe it could work.”</p><p>“Of course it could work!” Mietzie exulted, then asked, “What could workexactly?”</p><p>’Gina turned to her. “I am going to be sent to school. Le Grande EcoleCamford. I am going disguised as the rich daughter of one of yourMother’s cousins. There are some things I am supposed to learn there.”</p><p>“Well of course you’ll learn things at school, but why…Oh! <b>learn</b>there. I get it. You’re going to be a spy!”</p><p>“I think not.” the Queen interjected. “Better one say an observer. Therewill be no skulduggery or escapades. Regina will be entirely a student,and like all students will work and study and play. It is perhapspossible that she may hear some gossip that she believes may be ofinterest to me, but she is not, and I repeat not,” here with a stonystare at ’Gina, “to go investigating.”</p><p>“This will be such fun.” said Mietzie. “We will have such fun together.I will be ever so helpful as your servant, and in your notinvestigating.”</p><p>“What do you know about being a servant Mietzie? You have enough troublebehaving like a Princess.” Albrecht added.</p><p>“Right you are Albrecht“ said the Queen.”And given your analysis of thesituation, and since it was after all, and to your credit, your idea, Icharge you with the supervision of Mietzie’s lessons in basic servitude.Please keep me fully informed of her progress.”</p></root><a href="chapter6.html">Prior Chapter An Education</a><p><a href="chapter8.html">Next Chapter Mucking</a></p></body></html>
