The lessons were, for the most part, the<br/>easiest part of her day. The lessons of Monsieur Franz had been more<br/>intense than those of most of her classmates. For most of her classes<br/>she knew all the material, but Regina did her best to disguise this. She<br/>offered an occasional answer, but Regina also made sure that some of<br/>them were wrong. Regina guessed that it would be easier to learn the<br/>secrets of her classmates if she did not annoy them by being a<br/>know-it-all. Regina still wondered if it was worth it. Most of the<br/>students Regina had met seemed more interested in hemlines and fashions<br/>than academics. Regina found it hard to learn about their families when<br/>the students were in their turn pressing hard to learn about her family.</p><p>On a couple of occasions Regina had been forced to concoct small lies to<br/>give some color to her tales of Kaiserkönig home life. Now Regina<br/>worried that it would be through these small fabrications that she would<br/>be found out. Regina also now had to keep her little lies straight so<br/>that she did not contradict herself. Keeping track of all these details<br/>and the respective status of all her classmates exhausted her. Who<br/>deferred to her? Why? Who did she defer to? Who was an equal. It was so<br/>much simpler at home: she bowed to everyone who was upstairs. She used<br/>the last name of anyone downstairs who was older than she was. And she<br/>remained friendly with all. Regina did not have to worry what each<br/>little gesture or phrase might mean for her mission or her safety.</p><p>As a result of this combination of stress and ennui, Regina begun to<br/>spend more and more time in her room. Often she simply slept; too tired<br/>to do anything else. When Regina did have some energy, she wrote long<br/>meaningless letters home. Never able to tell the truth, she never the<br/>less put in lots of details and academy gossip in hopes that Mr.<br/>Goldthread might make a connection, and that when the letters were<br/>passed on to her mother they would put her mother at ease and convince<br/>her that Regina was enjoying herself. In fact, Mr. Goldthread found no<br/>connections, and Regina’s mother grew very sad, because she immediately<br/>saw through the false cheer. Mothers know their daughters. And Regina’s<br/>mother knew that Regina was unhappy. Regina was far from home. Alone.<br/>Regina was on a private mission that kept her from honest discussions,<br/>and she was learning less academically than she had at home. Still,<br/>Regina’s mother did take comfort in seeing in Regina’s notes that Regina<br/>was internalizing the distinctions of aristocratic life, and was,<br/>despite herself, being made conversant with that culture.</p><p>One afternoon Regina fell asleep on top of the letter she was writing<br/>home. There came a gentle rap at her door. It was Helene, almost the<br/>only person at the school whose company Regina enjoyed. Helene greeted<br/>Regina with a titter. Catching a glimpse of herself in the vanity mirror<br/>Regina saw the purple ink from her letter printed on her cheek. Even<br/>backwards in the mirror she could read what was written.</p><p>“Gracious!” said Regina. And she began to scrub at the cheek with a<br/>handkerchief.</p><p>“How are you Regina? I have not seen very much of you.” Helene asked<br/>while standing in the doorway.</p><p>“Come in. Please Helene,” Regina heard the sound of command in her voice<br/>and was surprised at how easily the character came to her. “Sit. Yes, I<br/>am sorry. I truly enjoy our visits. I have just been very tired.”</p><p>“I was tired too when I came here,” Helene said, “Even though my family<br/>is in town, and I get to go home every evening, I found it hard to be<br/>away so much. It must be very hard to be so far away from home and<br/>family.”</p><p>Regina immediately wanted to pour her heart out to this girl, but knew<br/>that she could not, and it made her sadder. “Yes. It is tiring. But tell<br/>me instead what you have been up to.” Regina knew that many of the girls<br/>Helene’s age (she was a year or two younger than Regina) did not like<br/>Helene. Helene had the reputation of being too intelligent, and not<br/>sophisticated enough. This meant Helene was more interested in lessons<br/>than in fashion.</p><p>“Oh not much. Diego got a new job. He works in the mail room now sorting<br/>the mail. Apparently, the Head Mistress has taken a liking to him. I<br/>wish she liked me better.” Every child at the school was given some<br/>chore or responsibility. It was supposed to be a character building<br/>exercise.</p><p>“She likes you,” Regina said, perhaps not convincingly. “You are just so<br/>focused on your studies that you don’t always see the effect you have on<br/>people. Further, it is not important how many friends you have, but the<br/>depth of the friendships you do have. I have only one real friend back<br/>home,” Regina’s thoughts drifted to Mietzie, “and I would not trade her<br/>for a hundred lesser friends. And you have a good friend here in me.”<br/>Regina reached over and gave a squeeze to Helene’s hand. Regina felt<br/>warm doing it. She did like Helene, and while she felt guilty at the<br/>subterfuge, she did want a friend here.</p><p>“I am so happy to hear you say that.” Helene smiled, “I thought we were<br/>friends, but I sometimes have troubling telling what people are<br/>thinking. They are not like numbers.”</p><p>“No,” said Regina, “but they still count.” Helene exploded in laughter,<br/>and Regina, who was a bit embarrassed by the simple pun she had made,<br/>grew warm seeing the young girl enjoy it so.</p><p>“I am going to tell that one to Diego.” Helene said.</p><p>“Regina,” Helene continued, “if we are friends … I mean, since we are<br/>friends, would you like to come to have dinner with me at my home? Diego<br/>and my parents will be there, but it could still be fun, and my Mother<br/>said it would be okay, and I could show you my room, and my dog, and we<br/>have a really nice embassy, and the cook is very good, and she said she<br/>would make whatever I asked, so I need to know what you would like to<br/>eat…”</p><p>Regina interrupted her with laughter. “Yes. Yes. I will come. Please<br/>breathe.” Regina was happy to accept the invitation, but it also gave<br/>her a little bit of hope that she might finally learn something more<br/>than who had kissed whom, and which family was deemed in or out of favor<br/>with the Queen (who was often described in less than flattering terms by<br/>the children of the foreign embassies). “Come along now Helene, or we<br/>will be late for Head Mistresses’ class.”</p><p>The smiles both girls wore were masked as soon as they entered the<br/>classroom. Students filed in quietly and efficiently. The Head Mistress<br/>sat without speaking at a desk in the front of the classroom. She<br/>watched the children enter. It was unnerving to meet her cold gaze in<br/>the few minutes of transition before class began. Regina and Helene<br/>parted, each taking their assigned seat. Miss Bostick’s only movement<br/>was the swiveling of her eyes as she tracked Regina to her seat. All the<br/>children were in place, and the wall clock lightly chimed the hour. With<br/>its last note Miss Bostick stood up. “Good afternoon students.” And the<br/>students echoed back “Good afternoon Head Mistress.”</p><p>“Today we begin our lessons of higher dimensional geometry and their<br/>algebraic description. I assume you all read the assigned pages in your<br/>book,” Miss Bostick’s sarcasm was apparent in her voice, and she blocked<br/>Helene’s response by immediately continuing. “If you had, you would have<br/>known that the hero of this story is Monsieur René Descartes. A<br/>Frenchman, but intelligent none the less, he watched one day as a fly<br/>walked along the wall of the room where he sat. Monsieur Descartes<br/>realized that the fly’s path was a curve in space, and that one could<br/>use an equation to describe the progress of the fly. Thus, he recognized<br/>that one could use either an algebraic equation or a geometric<br/>illustration to describe the same thing, and that it might be possible<br/>to go back and forth between the two equivalent formulations depending<br/>on which was the more convenient. Today, as I want to extend your<br/>thinking from two dimensions to three, and in honor of Monsieur<br/>Descartes, I elect to imitate his method.”</p><p>Miss Bostick reached into a desk drawer and took out a small box. She<br/>continued lecturing. “I was afraid a fly might be too small for those in<br/>the back to see… ASSUMING THEIR EYES WERE OPEN. Diego!” Immediately<br/>everyone sat up straighter in their chairs, and pointedly did not look<br/>at Diego who had abruptly jerked himself erect. “And so, I had the<br/>gardeners bring me this bumblebee.” Miss Bostick opened the box, and a<br/>bumblebee immediately flew out, but then hovered in the air a foot or so<br/>from the box. It was tethered by a small thread. “I have glued this<br/>thread to the thorax of the bee, and have anchored the other end in the<br/>box with a pin.” The bumblebee repeatedly redirected his flight in<br/>multiple directions always at the end of its thread leash. It’s flight<br/>was silent, but frantic. “Tell me class. What shape can the flight of<br/>the bumblebee describe?” There was the usual silence that follows a<br/>teacher’s question. “You, Miss Kaiserkönig. You’re often less stupid<br/>than the others. What shape is the bumblebee illustrating?”</p><p>Regina took a deep breath and spoke with great effort in a calm voice.<br/>“Well…The thread is of a fixed length…I guess it would be … yes it<br/>must be… a sphere. The thread is the radius, and there are three<br/>dimensions. It is describing a sphere. A rather sad sphere if you ask<br/>me.”</p><p>“I did not ask you for your characterization of the bumblebee’s state of<br/>mind, which is, though pin-sized, equal I hypothesize to some in this<br/>classroom. Diego wake up!” Another abrupt jerk from Diego who had in<br/>fact been watching the bumblebee and listening carefully. “But you are<br/>right. It is a sphere. No reason to be so self-satisfied. That answer is<br/>the obvious one. The only one. What we are here to do today is to become<br/>Cartesians. How do we translate that shape, that path of the bumblebee’s<br/>flight, to an algebraic description?”</p><p>Regina enjoyed being challenged in her classes, but not belittled. Her<br/>face reddened, and she found the anger distracting her from thinking<br/>clearly. “Angles? Maybe?”</p><p>“Angle? Maybe?” The Head Mistress aped her puzzled tone. “You may sit<br/>back down Miss Kaiserkönig. Angles. Hmph. Anyone else who would like to<br/>embarrass themselves with a wrong answer.” Miss Bostick took a long time<br/>surveying her silent class. Every head turned away from her with the<br/>exception of Regina’s angry glare and Helene’s optimistic one.<br/>Resignedly, Miss Bostick said, “Yes. Helene, by all means tell them what<br/>the answer is.”</p><p>“A coordinate system ma’am. Like we learned last week, but instead of<br/>just two axes we could use three all at right angles, and then …”</p><p>“Yes,” Miss Bostick interrupted, “three dimensional coordinate system is<br/>enough. No one likes a show-off. Do they class?” And the Head Mistress’s<br/>question led to titters and an embarrassed blush on Helene who then<br/>lowered her face on her desk. Regina was momentarily paralyzed by her<br/>anger. In that moment Miss Bostick began to wind up the thread reeling<br/>in the frantic bumblebee ever closer to the small box. Grabbing the bee<br/>with her hand Miss Bostick, with difficulty, forced it into the box and<br/>pressed the lid down. The lid of the box clipped one wing, and that<br/>fragment outside the box could be seen to be beating furiously. Every<br/>eye was riveted by this return to cruel captivity, and Miss Bostick<br/>surveyed the children with a rather pleased look on her face that<br/>quickly clouded when she saw Regina stand. “Sit down. The lesson is not<br/>over.”</p><p>Regina met her gaze, and the fog of her anger subsided as she focused on<br/>a purpose. She tried to remember the few times she had heard the Queen<br/>speak at her most commanding. The Queen’s voice was never loud, but it<br/>was always very measured. Very direct. Regina reached for that voice now<br/>as she walked up to the Head Mistresses’ desk. “I have just recalled,<br/>Head Mistress, that I was to write today a letter to my Aunt, the one<br/>true and eternal Queen, a report of the quality of the education I am<br/>receiving at this school.” With her gaze still meeting Miss Bostick’s<br/>Regina reached out and pulled the small bumblebee box from under the<br/>Head Mistresses’ hand. Without turning around she said, “Come Helene. I<br/>may need to borrow some paper and ink.” And with her best effort at<br/>Queenly haughtiness she swung about to face her classmates, pried open<br/>the box, snapped the thread, and released the crippled bumblebee. With a<br/>royal pace Helene and Regina marched from the room.</p></root><a href="chapter11.html">Prior Chapter Schooled</a><p><a href="chapter13.html">Next Chapter Going Postal</a></p></body></html>
