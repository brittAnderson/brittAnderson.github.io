The lessons were, for the most part, the easiest part of her day. The lessons of Monsieur Franz had been more intense than those of most of her classmates. For most of her classes she knew all the material, but Regina did her best to disguise this. She offered an occasional answer, but Regina also made sure that some of them were wrong. Regina guessed that it would be easier to learn the secrets of her classmates if she did not annoy them by being a know-it-all. Regina still wondered if it was worth it. Most of the students Regina had met seemed more interested in hemlines and fashions than academics. Regina found it hard to learn about their families when the students were in their turn pressing hard to learn about her family.</p><p>On a couple of occasions Regina had been forced to concoct small lies to give some color to her tales of Kaiserkönig home life. Now Regina worried that it would be through these small fabrications that she would be found out. Regina also now had to keep her little lies straight so that she did not contradict herself. Keeping track of all these details and the respective status of all her classmates exhausted her. Who deferred to her? Why? Who did she defer to? Who was an equal. It was so much simpler at home: she bowed to everyone who was upstairs. She used the last name of anyone downstairs who was older than she was. And she remained friendly with all. Regina did not have to worry what each little gesture or phrase might mean for her mission or her safety.</p><p>As a result of this combination of stress and ennui, Regina begun to spend more and more time in her room. Often she simply slept; too tired to do anything else. When Regina did have some energy, she wrote long meaningless letters home. Never able to tell the truth, she never the less put in lots of details and academy gossip in hopes that Mr. Goldthread might make a connection, and that when the letters were passed on to her mother they would put her mother at ease and convince her that Regina was enjoying herself. In fact, Mr. Goldthread found no connections, and Regina’s mother grew very sad, because she immediately saw through the false cheer. Mothers know their daughters. And Regina’s mother knew that Regina was unhappy. Regina was far from home. Alone. Regina was on a private mission that kept her from honest discussions, and she was learning less academically than she had at home. Still, Regina’s mother did take comfort in seeing in Regina’s notes that Regina was internalizing the distinctions of aristocratic life, and was, despite herself, being made conversant with that culture.</p><p>One afternoon Regina fell asleep on top of the letter she was writing home. There came a gentle rap at her door. It was Helene, almost the only person at the school whose company Regina enjoyed. Helene greeted Regina with a titter. Catching a glimpse of herself in the vanity mirror Regina saw the purple ink from her letter printed on her cheek. Even backwards in the mirror she could read what was written.</p><p>“Gracious!” said Regina. And she began to scrub at the cheek with a handkerchief.</p><p>“How are you Regina? I have not seen very much of you.” Helene asked while standing in the doorway.</p><p>“Come in. Please Helene,” Regina heard the sound of command in her voice and was surprised at how easily the character came to her. “Sit. Yes, I am sorry. I truly enjoy our visits. I have just been very tired.”</p><p>“I was tired too when I came here,” Helene said, “Even though my family is in town, and I get to go home every evening, I found it hard to be away so much. It must be very hard to be so far away from home and family.”</p><p>Regina immediately wanted to pour her heart out to this girl, but knew that she could not, and it made her sadder. “Yes. It is tiring. But tell me instead what you have been up to.” Regina knew that many of the girls Helene’s age (she was a year or two younger than Regina) did not like Helene. Helene had the reputation of being too intelligent, and not sophisticated enough. This meant Helene was more interested in lessons than in fashion.</p><p>“Oh not much. Diego got a new job. He works in the mail room now sorting the mail. Apparently, the Head Mistress has taken a liking to him. I wish she liked me better.” Every child at the school was given some chore or responsibility. It was supposed to be a character building exercise.</p><p>“She likes you,” Regina said, perhaps not convincingly. “You are just so focused on your studies that you don’t always see the effect you have on people. Further, it is not important how many friends you have, but the depth of the friendships you do have. I have only one real friend back home,” Regina’s thoughts drifted to Mietzie, “and I would not trade her for a hundred lesser friends. And you have a good friend here in me.” Regina reached over and gave a squeeze to Helene’s hand. Regina felt warm doing it. She did like Helene, and while she felt guilty at the subterfuge, she did want a friend here.</p><p>“I am so happy to hear you say that.” Helene smiled, “I thought we were friends, but I sometimes have troubling telling what people are thinking. They are not like numbers.”</p><p>“No,” said Regina, “but they still count.” Helene exploded in laughter, and Regina, who was a bit embarrassed by the simple pun she had made, grew warm seeing the young girl enjoy it so.</p><p>“I am going to tell that one to Diego.” Helene said.</p><p>“Regina,” Helene continued, “if we are friends … I mean, since we are friends, would you like to come to have dinner with me at my home? Diego and my parents will be there, but it could still be fun, and my Mother said it would be okay, and I could show you my room, and my dog, and we have a really nice embassy, and the cook is very good, and she said she would make whatever I asked, so I need to know what you would like to eat…”</p><p>Regina interrupted her with laughter. “Yes. Yes. I will come. Please breathe.” Regina was happy to accept the invitation, but it also gave her a little bit of hope that she might finally learn something more than who had kissed whom, and which family was deemed in or out of favor with the Queen (who was often described in less than flattering terms by the children of the foreign embassies). “Come along now Helene, or we will be late for Head Mistresses’ class.”</p><p>The smiles both girls wore were masked as soon as they entered the classroom. Students filed in quietly and efficiently. The Head Mistress sat without speaking at a desk in the front of the classroom. She watched the children enter. It was unnerving to meet her cold gaze in the few minutes of transition before class began. Regina and Helene parted, each taking their assigned seat. Miss Bostick’s only movement was the swiveling of her eyes as she tracked Regina to her seat. All the children were in place, and the wall clock lightly chimed the hour. With its last note Miss Bostick stood up. “Good afternoon students.” And the students echoed back “Good afternoon Head Mistress.”</p><p>“Today we begin our lessons of higher dimensional geometry and their algebraic description. I assume you all read the assigned pages in your book,” Miss Bostick’s sarcasm was apparent in her voice, and she blocked Helene’s response by immediately continuing. “If you had, you would have known that the hero of this story is Monsieur René Descartes. A Frenchman, but intelligent none the less, he watched one day as a fly walked along the wall of the room where he sat. Monsieur Descartes realized that the fly’s path was a curve in space, and that one could use an equation to describe the progress of the fly. Thus, he recognized that one could use either an algebraic equation or a geometric illustration to describe the same thing, and that it might be possible to go back and forth between the two equivalent formulations depending on which was the more convenient. Today, as I want to extend your thinking from two dimensions to three, and in honor of Monsieur Descartes, I elect to imitate his method.”</p><p>Miss Bostick reached into a desk drawer and took out a small box. She continued lecturing. “I was afraid a fly might be too small for those in the back to see… ASSUMING THEIR EYES WERE OPEN. Diego!” Immediately everyone sat up straighter in their chairs, and pointedly did not look at Diego who had abruptly jerked himself erect. “And so, I had the gardeners bring me this bumblebee.” Miss Bostick opened the box, and a bumblebee immediately flew out, but then hovered in the air a foot or so from the box. It was tethered by a small thread. “I have glued this thread to the thorax of the bee, and have anchored the other end in the box with a pin.” The bumblebee repeatedly redirected his flight in multiple directions always at the end of its thread leash. It’s flight was silent, but frantic. “Tell me class. What shape can the flight of the bumblebee describe?” There was the usual silence that follows a teacher’s question. “You, Miss Kaiserkönig. You’re often less stupid than the others. What shape is the bumblebee illustrating?”</p><p>Regina took a deep breath and spoke with great effort in a calm voice. “Well…The thread is of a fixed length…I guess it would be … yes it must be… a sphere. The thread is the radius, and there are three dimensions. It is describing a sphere. A rather sad sphere if you ask me.”</p><p>“I did not ask you for your characterization of the bumblebee’s state of mind, which is, though pin-sized, equal I hypothesize to some in this classroom. Diego wake up!” Another abrupt jerk from Diego who had in fact been watching the bumblebee and listening carefully. “But you are right. It is a sphere. No reason to be so self-satisfied. That answer is the obvious one. The only one. What we are here to do today is to become Cartesians. How do we translate that shape, that path of the bumblebee’s flight, to an algebraic description?”</p><p>Regina enjoyed being challenged in her classes, but not belittled. Her face reddened, and she found the anger distracting her from thinking clearly. “Angles? Maybe?”</p><p>“Angle? Maybe?” The Head Mistress aped her puzzled tone. “You may sit back down Miss Kaiserkönig. Angles. Hmph. Anyone else who would like to embarrass themselves with a wrong answer.” Miss Bostick took a long time surveying her silent class. Every head turned away from her with the exception of Regina’s angry glare and Helene’s optimistic one. Resignedly, Miss Bostick said, “Yes. Helene, by all means tell them what the answer is.”</p><p>“A coordinate system ma’am. Like we learned last week, but instead of just two axes we could use three all at right angles, and then …”</p><p>“Yes,” Miss Bostick interrupted, “three dimensional coordinate system is enough. No one likes a show-off. Do they class?” And the Head Mistress’s question led to titters and an embarrassed blush on Helene who then lowered her face on her desk. Regina was momentarily paralyzed by her anger. In that moment Miss Bostick began to wind up the thread reeling in the frantic bumblebee ever closer to the small box. Grabbing the bee with her hand Miss Bostick, with difficulty, forced it into the box and pressed the lid down. The lid of the box clipped one wing, and that fragment outside the box could be seen to be beating furiously. Every eye was riveted by this return to cruel captivity, and Miss Bostick surveyed the children with a rather pleased look on her face that quickly clouded when she saw Regina stand. “Sit down. The lesson is not over.”</p><p>Regina met her gaze, and the fog of her anger subsided as she focused on a purpose. She tried to remember the few times she had heard the Queen speak at her most commanding. The Queen’s voice was never loud, but it was always very measured. Very direct. Regina reached for that voice now as she walked up to the Head Mistresses’ desk. “I have just recalled, Head Mistress, that I was to write today a letter to my Aunt, the one true and eternal Queen, a report of the quality of the education I am receiving at this school.” With her gaze still meeting Miss Bostick’s Regina reached out and pulled the small bumblebee box from under the Head Mistresses’ hand. Without turning around she said, “Come Helene. I may need to borrow some paper and ink.” And with her best effort at Queenly haughtiness she swung about to face her classmates, pried open the box, snapped the thread, and released the crippled bumblebee. With a royal pace Helene and Regina marched from the room.</p></root><a href="chapter11.html">Prior Chapter Schooled</a><p><a href="chapter13.html">Next Chapter Going Postal</a></p></body></html>
