The lessons were, for the most part, theeasiest part of her day. The lessons of Monsieur Franz had been moreintense than those of most of her classmates. For most of her classesshe knew all the material, but Regina did her best to disguise this. Sheoffered an occasional answer, but Regina also made sure that some ofthem were wrong. Regina guessed that it would be easier to learn thesecrets of her classmates if she did not annoy them by being aknow-it-all. Regina still wondered if it was worth it. Most of thestudents Regina had met seemed more interested in hemlines and fashionsthan academics. Regina found it hard to learn about their families whenthe students were in their turn pressing hard to learn about her family.</p><p>On a couple of occasions Regina had been forced to concoct small lies togive some color to her tales of Kaiserkönig home life. Now Reginaworried that it would be through these small fabrications that she wouldbe found out. Regina also now had to keep her little lies straight sothat she did not contradict herself. Keeping track of all these detailsand the respective status of all her classmates exhausted her. Whodeferred to her? Why? Who did she defer to? Who was an equal. It was somuch simpler at home: she bowed to everyone who was upstairs. She usedthe last name of anyone downstairs who was older than she was. And sheremained friendly with all. Regina did not have to worry what eachlittle gesture or phrase might mean for her mission or her safety.</p><p>As a result of this combination of stress and ennui, Regina begun tospend more and more time in her room. Often she simply slept; too tiredto do anything else. When Regina did have some energy, she wrote longmeaningless letters home. Never able to tell the truth, she never theless put in lots of details and academy gossip in hopes that Mr.Goldthread might make a connection, and that when the letters werepassed on to her mother they would put her mother at ease and convinceher that Regina was enjoying herself. In fact, Mr. Goldthread found noconnections, and Regina’s mother grew very sad, because she immediatelysaw through the false cheer. Mothers know their daughters. And Regina’smother knew that Regina was unhappy. Regina was far from home. Alone.Regina was on a private mission that kept her from honest discussions,and she was learning less academically than she had at home. Still,Regina’s mother did take comfort in seeing in Regina’s notes that Reginawas internalizing the distinctions of aristocratic life, and was,despite herself, being made conversant with that culture.</p><p>One afternoon Regina fell asleep on top of the letter she was writinghome. There came a gentle rap at her door. It was Helene, almost theonly person at the school whose company Regina enjoyed. Helene greetedRegina with a titter. Catching a glimpse of herself in the vanity mirrorRegina saw the purple ink from her letter printed on her cheek. Evenbackwards in the mirror she could read what was written.</p><p>“Gracious!” said Regina. And she began to scrub at the cheek with ahandkerchief.</p><p>“How are you Regina? I have not seen very much of you.” Helene askedwhile standing in the doorway.</p><p>“Come in. Please Helene,” Regina heard the sound of command in her voiceand was surprised at how easily the character came to her. “Sit. Yes, Iam sorry. I truly enjoy our visits. I have just been very tired.”</p><p>“I was tired too when I came here,” Helene said, “Even though my familyis in town, and I get to go home every evening, I found it hard to beaway so much. It must be very hard to be so far away from home andfamily.”</p><p>Regina immediately wanted to pour her heart out to this girl, but knewthat she could not, and it made her sadder. “Yes. It is tiring. But tellme instead what you have been up to.” Regina knew that many of the girlsHelene’s age (she was a year or two younger than Regina) did not likeHelene. Helene had the reputation of being too intelligent, and notsophisticated enough. This meant Helene was more interested in lessonsthan in fashion.</p><p>“Oh not much. Diego got a new job. He works in the mail room now sortingthe mail. Apparently, the Head Mistress has taken a liking to him. Iwish she liked me better.” Every child at the school was given somechore or responsibility. It was supposed to be a character buildingexercise.</p><p>“She likes you,” Regina said, perhaps not convincingly. “You are just sofocused on your studies that you don’t always see the effect you have onpeople. Further, it is not important how many friends you have, but thedepth of the friendships you do have. I have only one real friend backhome,” Regina’s thoughts drifted to Mietzie, “and I would not trade herfor a hundred lesser friends. And you have a good friend here in me.”Regina reached over and gave a squeeze to Helene’s hand. Regina feltwarm doing it. She did like Helene, and while she felt guilty at thesubterfuge, she did want a friend here.</p><p>“I am so happy to hear you say that.” Helene smiled, “I thought we werefriends, but I sometimes have troubling telling what people arethinking. They are not like numbers.”</p><p>“No,” said Regina, “but they still count.” Helene exploded in laughter,and Regina, who was a bit embarrassed by the simple pun she had made,grew warm seeing the young girl enjoy it so.</p><p>“I am going to tell that one to Diego.” Helene said.</p><p>“Regina,” Helene continued, “if we are friends … I mean, since we arefriends, would you like to come to have dinner with me at my home? Diegoand my parents will be there, but it could still be fun, and my Mothersaid it would be okay, and I could show you my room, and my dog, and wehave a really nice embassy, and the cook is very good, and she said shewould make whatever I asked, so I need to know what you would like toeat…”</p><p>Regina interrupted her with laughter. “Yes. Yes. I will come. Pleasebreathe.” Regina was happy to accept the invitation, but it also gaveher a little bit of hope that she might finally learn something morethan who had kissed whom, and which family was deemed in or out of favorwith the Queen (who was often described in less than flattering terms bythe children of the foreign embassies). “Come along now Helene, or wewill be late for Head Mistresses’ class.”</p><p>The smiles both girls wore were masked as soon as they entered theclassroom. Students filed in quietly and efficiently. The Head Mistresssat without speaking at a desk in the front of the classroom. Shewatched the children enter. It was unnerving to meet her cold gaze inthe few minutes of transition before class began. Regina and Heleneparted, each taking their assigned seat. Miss Bostick’s only movementwas the swiveling of her eyes as she tracked Regina to her seat. All thechildren were in place, and the wall clock lightly chimed the hour. Withits last note Miss Bostick stood up. “Good afternoon students.” And thestudents echoed back “Good afternoon Head Mistress.”</p><p>“Today we begin our lessons of higher dimensional geometry and theiralgebraic description. I assume you all read the assigned pages in yourbook,” Miss Bostick’s sarcasm was apparent in her voice, and she blockedHelene’s response by immediately continuing. “If you had, you would haveknown that the hero of this story is Monsieur René Descartes. AFrenchman, but intelligent none the less, he watched one day as a flywalked along the wall of the room where he sat. Monsieur Descartesrealized that the fly’s path was a curve in space, and that one coulduse an equation to describe the progress of the fly. Thus, he recognizedthat one could use either an algebraic equation or a geometricillustration to describe the same thing, and that it might be possibleto go back and forth between the two equivalent formulations dependingon which was the more convenient. Today, as I want to extend yourthinking from two dimensions to three, and in honor of MonsieurDescartes, I elect to imitate his method.”</p><p>Miss Bostick reached into a desk drawer and took out a small box. Shecontinued lecturing. “I was afraid a fly might be too small for those inthe back to see… ASSUMING THEIR EYES WERE OPEN. Diego!” Immediatelyeveryone sat up straighter in their chairs, and pointedly did not lookat Diego who had abruptly jerked himself erect. “And so, I had thegardeners bring me this bumblebee.” Miss Bostick opened the box, and abumblebee immediately flew out, but then hovered in the air a foot or sofrom the box. It was tethered by a small thread. “I have glued thisthread to the thorax of the bee, and have anchored the other end in thebox with a pin.” The bumblebee repeatedly redirected his flight inmultiple directions always at the end of its thread leash. It’s flightwas silent, but frantic. “Tell me class. What shape can the flight ofthe bumblebee describe?” There was the usual silence that follows ateacher’s question. “You, Miss Kaiserkönig. You’re often less stupidthan the others. What shape is the bumblebee illustrating?”</p><p>Regina took a deep breath and spoke with great effort in a calm voice.“Well…The thread is of a fixed length…I guess it would be … yes itmust be… a sphere. The thread is the radius, and there are threedimensions. It is describing a sphere. A rather sad sphere if you askme.”</p><p>“I did not ask you for your characterization of the bumblebee’s state ofmind, which is, though pin-sized, equal I hypothesize to some in thisclassroom. Diego wake up!” Another abrupt jerk from Diego who had infact been watching the bumblebee and listening carefully. “But you areright. It is a sphere. No reason to be so self-satisfied. That answer isthe obvious one. The only one. What we are here to do today is to becomeCartesians. How do we translate that shape, that path of the bumblebee’sflight, to an algebraic description?”</p><p>Regina enjoyed being challenged in her classes, but not belittled. Herface reddened, and she found the anger distracting her from thinkingclearly. “Angles? Maybe?”</p><p>“Angle? Maybe?” The Head Mistress aped her puzzled tone. “You may sitback down Miss Kaiserkönig. Angles. Hmph. Anyone else who would like toembarrass themselves with a wrong answer.” Miss Bostick took a long timesurveying her silent class. Every head turned away from her with theexception of Regina’s angry glare and Helene’s optimistic one.Resignedly, Miss Bostick said, “Yes. Helene, by all means tell them whatthe answer is.”</p><p>“A coordinate system ma’am. Like we learned last week, but instead ofjust two axes we could use three all at right angles, and then …”</p><p>“Yes,” Miss Bostick interrupted, “three dimensional coordinate system isenough. No one likes a show-off. Do they class?” And the Head Mistress’squestion led to titters and an embarrassed blush on Helene who thenlowered her face on her desk. Regina was momentarily paralyzed by heranger. In that moment Miss Bostick began to wind up the thread reelingin the frantic bumblebee ever closer to the small box. Grabbing the beewith her hand Miss Bostick, with difficulty, forced it into the box andpressed the lid down. The lid of the box clipped one wing, and thatfragment outside the box could be seen to be beating furiously. Everyeye was riveted by this return to cruel captivity, and Miss Bosticksurveyed the children with a rather pleased look on her face thatquickly clouded when she saw Regina stand. “Sit down. The lesson is notover.”</p><p>Regina met her gaze, and the fog of her anger subsided as she focused ona purpose. She tried to remember the few times she had heard the Queenspeak at her most commanding. The Queen’s voice was never loud, but itwas always very measured. Very direct. Regina reached for that voice nowas she walked up to the Head Mistresses’ desk. “I have just recalled,Head Mistress, that I was to write today a letter to my Aunt, the onetrue and eternal Queen, a report of the quality of the education I amreceiving at this school.” With her gaze still meeting Miss Bostick’sRegina reached out and pulled the small bumblebee box from under theHead Mistresses’ hand. Without turning around she said, “Come Helene. Imay need to borrow some paper and ink.” And with her best effort atQueenly haughtiness she swung about to face her classmates, pried openthe box, snapped the thread, and released the crippled bumblebee. With aroyal pace Helene and Regina marched from the room.</p></root><a href="chapter11.html">Prior Chapter Schooled</a><p><a href="chapter13.html">Next Chapter Going Postal</a></p></body></html>
