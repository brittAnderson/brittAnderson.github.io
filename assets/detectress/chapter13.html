Unlike the other children, who regarded their chores as aninjustice and did them either grudgingly, poorly, or not at all, ’Ginalooked forward to her chore. She mopped the hall frequently andthoroughly. She took pride in the quality of the work. It provided her acomforting sense of attachment to her former life as a maid’s daughterdwelling in the servants’ quarters. Often, as she mopped and swept, shewould look up to see Miss Bostick standing in the door to her officequietly watching. To anyone else it would have looked as if Miss Bostickwas simply monitoring ’Gina’s compliance with her assignment, but to’Gina her expression looked more angry than supervisory.</p><p>Today however there was no Miss Bostick in the doorway. With the recentexcitement in Miss Bostick’s classroom ’Gina had gained a reputation inthe school. She was even more sought out by the children of the minoraristocrats and ambassadors who saw in Janus Kaiserkönig another rung onthe social ladder they wished to climb. ’Gina had more visits, and moreconversations, but instead of making her feel popular they led her tofeel even more her lack of a true friend. ’Gina’s constant sense ofinsecurity and threat was magnified. In the beginning it had beenabstract, but now she found herself inspecting each of her conversationsfor signs of intrigue or deception. ’Gina baited her chats and inquirieswith traps for treachery. She felt herself sick inside for making jokesabout the Queen on the outside. ’Gina’s new found popularity was veryuseful in giving her access to more children and more information, butit was harmful to her psychology. She noticed that her dresses feltlooser. When the world of deceit became too much, and she needed amoment of relief and reflection, she found it in the calming rituals ofsweeping, cleaning, and mopping.</p><p>Now there was no more dust to sweep. No more mud to mop. To havecontinued would have been suspicious. As she was storing the pail andmop away ’Gina caught a glimpse of Diego walking down the hall. She hadnot had many occasions to speak to him. In math class he continued to betormented by Miss Bostick, and paradoxically this seemed to make himever more compliant. He worked harder to achieve her praise, despite herclear contempt. ’Gina was puzzled by his behavior, but she recognizedanother unhappy soul, and she walked down the hallway after him. ’Ginasaw him enter a room next to Miss Bostick’s office. ’Gina had not had achance to explore the administrative rooms, and she thought this mightbe a good opportunity. Diego had left the door open, and ’Gina peakedher head around the corner to see what it was before she entered.</p><p>’Gina found a long narrow hall that ended in a small room with woodenpigeon holes along the back wall and a door on each side. Next to thedoor on the right was a a canvas sack the size of a postman’s parcel,and ’Gina could see letters sticking out its top. ’Gina watched as Diegotook handfuls and quickly sorted them into the various cubbyholes thatmust have been assigned for each student. ’Gina did not know that Diegohad been assigned this chore. It used to be done by Helene. ’Ginawondered what had caused the re-assignment. Helene had seemed happy withher chore, but ’Gina also knew that several times she had received otherstudents’ mail, and they had received hers. Perhaps Helene’smathematical mind was not well adapted to the details of sorting anddelivery in the way that Diego’s was. In any case, ’Gina thought hecould use a friend, and was preparing to enter and say Hello when shesaw Diego take out one of the large, thick, and royally embossed lettersthat was clearly hers. To maintain the ruse that she was the niece of awoman who believed herself the Queen ’Gina’s false letters from homecame with a Royal presentation. Something made ’Gina pause. Perhaps itwas the break in Diego’s pattern of quickly glancing and sorting. Hestopped when he came to ’Gina’s letter, and moved it slowly in hishands, apparently double checking the address and seal. Then she saw himmove over to the other door on the opposite wall, and knock. The dooropened shortly after and a hand, the Head Mistress’s hand, reached inand relieved Diego of the letter. The door closed, and Diego moved awayto grab another fistful of letters for sorting.</p><p>’Gina was indignant. It was her mail. Hers’. The Head Mistress had noright to punish her by delaying her letters or discarding them. Phonythough they were, they were ’Gina’s tie to her old world, her old life,and all the people she cared about. She would give the Head Mistress apiece of her mind. ’Gina marched down the hallway, and knocked at theHead Mistresses door.</p><p>“One moment!”</p><p>This was a shouted command that came to ’Gina muffled through the thickdoor. ’Gina head a lock or bolt slide, and then after another moment,“Enter!”</p><p>’Gina walked in her lips held tight in anger. She looked about for herletter, but saw nothing. The Head Mistress was sitting in a relaxedposture behind her desk. A textbook was open in front of her, and a pileof what seemed to be class worksheets sat next to it. On the window silla small alcohol burner flamed, and on top of that a small tea kettlesteamed.</p><p>“Hello Miss Kaiserkönig. What a pleasure. What may I do for you?” andbefore ’Gina had had a chance to respond the Head Mistress continued.“Oh. May I offer you a cup of tea? I was about to have one myself?”</p><p>This kindness was unexpected, and ’Gina was confused by it. “Yes. PleaseMiss Bostick.”</p><p>“Good. Let me get us a couple of mugs.” And the Head Mistress rose,popped out of the room, and came back shortly with two cups, saucers, asmall pitcher of milk and some loose tea on a plate.</p><p>’Gina remained befuddled. Why was the Head Mistress being so nice to hernow when she was obviously delaying her mail as some sort of punishmentfor speaking out in class? The Head Mistress repeated her earlierquestion as she busied herself with the brewing and pouring of the tea.“So, Miss Kaiserkönig. Again, what may I do for you?” And she handed’Gina a cup of tea with milk.</p><p>’Gina stalled by taking a sip, and as she did she began to wonder whythe Head Mistress would have her tea kettle warming water for a pot oftea if she did not have a cup and saucer or tea for brewing it? As shesipped the answer abruptly came to her. If there was no tea suppliedthen the steaming kettle was obviously not meant for tea. It thus mustbe meant for something else. It was meant, ’Gina realized, for the steamitself. To steam open her letter. ’Gina felt dizzy for a moment, andthen she mumbled a question about being concerned with her math grade,and wondered when the test results would be made available.</p><p>“I am working on them right now,” replied the Head Mistress, “but Idon’t think you need worry too much. You are one of the top students inthe class, maybe you would be top if we didn’t have that fr.. if we didnot have a girl with Helene’s unique ability. In any case, they will allbe available to be returned next class. Now is there anything else?” Andthe Head Mistress actually smiled at her.</p><p>The Head Mistress was obviously trying to hide what she had been doing.She was trying to distract ’Gina by this change in attitude. ’Ginasipped her tea for something to do, and then said that there was nothingelse and took her leave from the Head Mistress. She began to feel moreangry and more alert as she walked down the hall. Something more wasgoing on than she had appreciated. The Head Mistress was not simply somedisappointed scholar taking out her failure on her young students, andshe was not simply entertaining herself with arbitrary punishments orprying into her students’ privacy. The Head Mistress was a calculatingliar who used threats and kindness to manipulate and co-opt others tohelp her in whatever it was she was doing. It now seemed to ’Gina thatthe Head Mistress was much more than just a mean teacher, or a badperson. She was “involved.”</p><p>The Head Mistress might be her first clue to the source of the threat tothe Queen. To go to such trouble as to read “Janus’s” mail the HeadMistress must be very suspicious of her. There was only reason to bethat suspicious was if the person themself had something to hide.Whatever was going on, the Head Mistress was part of it. ’Gina felt morethreatened than ever, but she also felt her mission more important thanbefore. The threats to her majesty were everywhere: castle, the school,adults, and children. ’Gina turned to go back upstairs to her room, butthen spun around again and entered the hallway to the mail room. Diegoheard her enter and turned.</p><p>“Oh. Hello Janus.”</p><p>“Hello Diego. I am expecting a letter from my Aunt. May I have itplease?”</p><p>’Gina watched carefully to see how Diego would respond. How much a partof this plot was he?</p><p>His reply came back after very little hesitation. “No. Not today. ButI’ll keep a look out for it, and bring it to you when it comes in.”</p><p>Thanking him ’Gina turned and left. She had no real information. Noinsight. She had learned though how extensive the threat was. The Queenwas not merely beset by some single agent in her castle. There was anetwork, and it penetrated the school where the town’s great and noblesent their children. It was not the Queen alone who was likely beingspied on, but the whole capital, and through a mean and nefarious avenuethat manipulated and exposed children to harm. Was Diego simply amisused boy seeking favor with the Head Mistress, or was he trulyinvolved? ’Gina felt angry at herself for not having detected thisbefore. She felt exposed. She stalked off to her room. What had beforebeen her sanctuary she now regarded as a redoubt. Her eyes were full ofunshed tears when she took shelter in her room.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>As ’Gina sat in her room she tried to puzzle out the actions of the HeadMistress and those of Diego. Was he just a confused boy trying to pleasethe Head Mistress? ’Gina had seen servants act the same way in thehousehold at home. Or was he in some way part of some plan on the HeadMistress’s part? And if so, what could it be? She was lost in thesethoughts when there was the light rap on her door that she recognized asHelene’s.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Helene peaked around the door as she opened it. Her eyes preceded hersmile. “Hi. I saw you had mail, and so I brought it up.”</p><p>“What?” ’Gina asked while taking the offered letter from Helene. “Howdid you get this?”</p><p>“It was in your mail slot. Diego told me I had some mail. When I went toget mine (he let’s me go in the mail room on my own) I saw you had aletter in your slot too, so I brought it up to you. Was that okay?”</p><p>“No. It’s fine. Thank you.” ’Gina turned the letter over in her hand,and looked at the seal on the back. She felt that it was slightly wavy,as if it had been exposed to moisture, but tearing it open she foundwhat looked like one of the typical faux updates she received on thetrue news of Andalonia. If anyone had access to news from Andalonia theywould find the stories true. They were of no real value to ’Gina, butshe still liked reading the letters and pretending they were from hermother.</p><p>“What will you be doing for the weekend Helene? I am afraid I will haveto study for our French and Math exams next week.”</p><p>“Oh. I’ll do that too.”</p><p>“No you will not,” ’Gina scolded with a smile. “Maybe French, but weboth know you could teach that math class, and the Head Mistress knowsit too.”</p><p>Helene looked down, embarrassed, but with a smile. “There’s something Iwanted to ask you. I hope it’s okay, but maybe, no you don’t have to. Idon’t know what I was …”</p><p>“Helene. Just ask me silly willy.” This made Helene giggle. ’Gina hadfelt suspicious when Helene brought her the letter that Diego, herbrother, had given to the Head Mistress and then lied about. But shecould not sustain her feeling. Helene was just too sweet and genuine.Too easily lost in self-doubt and embarrassment to succeed atsubterfuge. She was not a friend in the way Mietzie was. She was morelike a little sister, and ’Gina began to recognize that her attitudetoward Helene showed some of the same characteristics ’Gina hadwitnessed in Albrecht and his siblings.</p><p>“Do you want to come to dinner <b>this</b> Friday? That’s what I wrote Mamaand Father about. They said it was okay. You could come with me in thecarriage. Or take your own. I don’t know. Is it okay for you to ride ina carriage without a royal seal? I didn’t think of that. You aren’toffended are you?”</p><p>’Gina laughed. “Of course I am not offended. And I would love to dinewith your family this Friday, it would be such a pleasant distractionfrom school. It will put me in a fine mood for my weekend of study tobegin with a family feast. Thank you so much for your kind invitationtoo.”</p><p>“Oh you’re welcome. I always talk about you at home, and Diego does too,and my father is always asking questions. It was his idea to invite youso soon. He said you would probably enjoy a nice home cooked meal, andwe have two wonderful chefs. They can make whatever you want.”</p><p>And the two girls spent the next hour planning menus and picking out’Gina’s outfit for the Friday feast.</p></root><a href="chapter12.html">Prior Chapter Flight of the Bumblebee</a><p><a href="chapter14.html">Next Chapter Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner?</a></p></body></html>
