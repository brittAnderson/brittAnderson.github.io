Unlike the other children, who regarded their chores as an<br/>injustice and did them either grudgingly, poorly, or not at all, ’Gina<br/>looked forward to her chore. She mopped the hall frequently and<br/>thoroughly. She took pride in the quality of the work. It provided her a<br/>comforting sense of attachment to her former life as a maid’s daughter<br/>dwelling in the servants’ quarters. Often, as she mopped and swept, she<br/>would look up to see Miss Bostick standing in the door to her office<br/>quietly watching. To anyone else it would have looked as if Miss Bostick<br/>was simply monitoring ’Gina’s compliance with her assignment, but to<br/>’Gina her expression looked more angry than supervisory.</p><p>Today however there was no Miss Bostick in the doorway. With the recent<br/>excitement in Miss Bostick’s classroom ’Gina had gained a reputation in<br/>the school. She was even more sought out by the children of the minor<br/>aristocrats and ambassadors who saw in Janus Kaiserkönig another rung on<br/>the social ladder they wished to climb. ’Gina had more visits, and more<br/>conversations, but instead of making her feel popular they led her to<br/>feel even more her lack of a true friend. ’Gina’s constant sense of<br/>insecurity and threat was magnified. In the beginning it had been<br/>abstract, but now she found herself inspecting each of her conversations<br/>for signs of intrigue or deception. ’Gina baited her chats and inquiries<br/>with traps for treachery. She felt herself sick inside for making jokes<br/>about the Queen on the outside. ’Gina’s new found popularity was very<br/>useful in giving her access to more children and more information, but<br/>it was harmful to her psychology. She noticed that her dresses felt<br/>looser. When the world of deceit became too much, and she needed a<br/>moment of relief and reflection, she found it in the calming rituals of<br/>sweeping, cleaning, and mopping.</p><p>Now there was no more dust to sweep. No more mud to mop. To have<br/>continued would have been suspicious. As she was storing the pail and<br/>mop away ’Gina caught a glimpse of Diego walking down the hall. She had<br/>not had many occasions to speak to him. In math class he continued to be<br/>tormented by Miss Bostick, and paradoxically this seemed to make him<br/>ever more compliant. He worked harder to achieve her praise, despite her<br/>clear contempt. ’Gina was puzzled by his behavior, but she recognized<br/>another unhappy soul, and she walked down the hallway after him. ’Gina<br/>saw him enter a room next to Miss Bostick’s office. ’Gina had not had a<br/>chance to explore the administrative rooms, and she thought this might<br/>be a good opportunity. Diego had left the door open, and ’Gina peaked<br/>her head around the corner to see what it was before she entered.</p><p>’Gina found a long narrow hall that ended in a small room with wooden<br/>pigeon holes along the back wall and a door on each side. Next to the<br/>door on the right was a a canvas sack the size of a postman’s parcel,<br/>and ’Gina could see letters sticking out its top. ’Gina watched as Diego<br/>took handfuls and quickly sorted them into the various cubbyholes that<br/>must have been assigned for each student. ’Gina did not know that Diego<br/>had been assigned this chore. It used to be done by Helene. ’Gina<br/>wondered what had caused the re-assignment. Helene had seemed happy with<br/>her chore, but ’Gina also knew that several times she had received other<br/>students’ mail, and they had received hers. Perhaps Helene’s<br/>mathematical mind was not well adapted to the details of sorting and<br/>delivery in the way that Diego’s was. In any case, ’Gina thought he<br/>could use a friend, and was preparing to enter and say Hello when she<br/>saw Diego take out one of the large, thick, and royally embossed letters<br/>that was clearly hers. To maintain the ruse that she was the niece of a<br/>woman who believed herself the Queen ’Gina’s false letters from home<br/>came with a Royal presentation. Something made ’Gina pause. Perhaps it<br/>was the break in Diego’s pattern of quickly glancing and sorting. He<br/>stopped when he came to ’Gina’s letter, and moved it slowly in his<br/>hands, apparently double checking the address and seal. Then she saw him<br/>move over to the other door on the opposite wall, and knock. The door<br/>opened shortly after and a hand, the Head Mistress’s hand, reached in<br/>and relieved Diego of the letter. The door closed, and Diego moved away<br/>to grab another fistful of letters for sorting.</p><p>’Gina was indignant. It was her mail. Hers’. The Head Mistress had no<br/>right to punish her by delaying her letters or discarding them. Phony<br/>though they were, they were ’Gina’s tie to her old world, her old life,<br/>and all the people she cared about. She would give the Head Mistress a<br/>piece of her mind. ’Gina marched down the hallway, and knocked at the<br/>Head Mistresses door.</p><p>“One moment!”</p><p>This was a shouted command that came to ’Gina muffled through the thick<br/>door. ’Gina head a lock or bolt slide, and then after another moment,<br/>“Enter!”</p><p>’Gina walked in her lips held tight in anger. She looked about for her<br/>letter, but saw nothing. The Head Mistress was sitting in a relaxed<br/>posture behind her desk. A textbook was open in front of her, and a pile<br/>of what seemed to be class worksheets sat next to it. On the window sill<br/>a small alcohol burner flamed, and on top of that a small tea kettle<br/>steamed.</p><p>“Hello Miss Kaiserkönig. What a pleasure. What may I do for you?” and<br/>before ’Gina had had a chance to respond the Head Mistress continued.<br/>“Oh. May I offer you a cup of tea? I was about to have one myself?”</p><p>This kindness was unexpected, and ’Gina was confused by it. “Yes. Please<br/>Miss Bostick.”</p><p>“Good. Let me get us a couple of mugs.” And the Head Mistress rose,<br/>popped out of the room, and came back shortly with two cups, saucers, a<br/>small pitcher of milk and some loose tea on a plate.</p><p>’Gina remained befuddled. Why was the Head Mistress being so nice to her<br/>now when she was obviously delaying her mail as some sort of punishment<br/>for speaking out in class? The Head Mistress repeated her earlier<br/>question as she busied herself with the brewing and pouring of the tea.<br/>“So, Miss Kaiserkönig. Again, what may I do for you?” And she handed<br/>’Gina a cup of tea with milk.</p><p>’Gina stalled by taking a sip, and as she did she began to wonder why<br/>the Head Mistress would have her tea kettle warming water for a pot of<br/>tea if she did not have a cup and saucer or tea for brewing it? As she<br/>sipped the answer abruptly came to her. If there was no tea supplied<br/>then the steaming kettle was obviously not meant for tea. It thus must<br/>be meant for something else. It was meant, ’Gina realized, for the steam<br/>itself. To steam open her letter. ’Gina felt dizzy for a moment, and<br/>then she mumbled a question about being concerned with her math grade,<br/>and wondered when the test results would be made available.</p><p>“I am working on them right now,” replied the Head Mistress, “but I<br/>don’t think you need worry too much. You are one of the top students in<br/>the class, maybe you would be top if we didn’t have that fr.. if we did<br/>not have a girl with Helene’s unique ability. In any case, they will all<br/>be available to be returned next class. Now is there anything else?” And<br/>the Head Mistress actually smiled at her.</p><p>The Head Mistress was obviously trying to hide what she had been doing.<br/>She was trying to distract ’Gina by this change in attitude. ’Gina<br/>sipped her tea for something to do, and then said that there was nothing<br/>else and took her leave from the Head Mistress. She began to feel more<br/>angry and more alert as she walked down the hall. Something more was<br/>going on than she had appreciated. The Head Mistress was not simply some<br/>disappointed scholar taking out her failure on her young students, and<br/>she was not simply entertaining herself with arbitrary punishments or<br/>prying into her students’ privacy. The Head Mistress was a calculating<br/>liar who used threats and kindness to manipulate and co-opt others to<br/>help her in whatever it was she was doing. It now seemed to ’Gina that<br/>the Head Mistress was much more than just a mean teacher, or a bad<br/>person. She was “involved.”</p><p>The Head Mistress might be her first clue to the source of the threat to<br/>the Queen. To go to such trouble as to read “Janus’s” mail the Head<br/>Mistress must be very suspicious of her. There was only reason to be<br/>that suspicious was if the person themself had something to hide.<br/>Whatever was going on, the Head Mistress was part of it. ’Gina felt more<br/>threatened than ever, but she also felt her mission more important than<br/>before. The threats to her majesty were everywhere: castle, the school,<br/>adults, and children. ’Gina turned to go back upstairs to her room, but<br/>then spun around again and entered the hallway to the mail room. Diego<br/>heard her enter and turned.</p><p>“Oh. Hello Janus.”</p><p>“Hello Diego. I am expecting a letter from my Aunt. May I have it<br/>please?”</p><p>’Gina watched carefully to see how Diego would respond. How much a part<br/>of this plot was he?</p><p>His reply came back after very little hesitation. “No. Not today. But<br/>I’ll keep a look out for it, and bring it to you when it comes in.”</p><p>Thanking him ’Gina turned and left. She had no real information. No<br/>insight. She had learned though how extensive the threat was. The Queen<br/>was not merely beset by some single agent in her castle. There was a<br/>network, and it penetrated the school where the town’s great and noble<br/>sent their children. It was not the Queen alone who was likely being<br/>spied on, but the whole capital, and through a mean and nefarious avenue<br/>that manipulated and exposed children to harm. Was Diego simply a<br/>misused boy seeking favor with the Head Mistress, or was he truly<br/>involved? ’Gina felt angry at herself for not having detected this<br/>before. She felt exposed. She stalked off to her room. What had before<br/>been her sanctuary she now regarded as a redoubt. Her eyes were full of<br/>unshed tears when she took shelter in her room.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>As ’Gina sat in her room she tried to puzzle out the actions of the Head<br/>Mistress and those of Diego. Was he just a confused boy trying to please<br/>the Head Mistress? ’Gina had seen servants act the same way in the<br/>household at home. Or was he in some way part of some plan on the Head<br/>Mistress’s part? And if so, what could it be? She was lost in these<br/>thoughts when there was the light rap on her door that she recognized as<br/>Helene’s.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Helene peaked around the door as she opened it. Her eyes preceded her<br/>smile. “Hi. I saw you had mail, and so I brought it up.”</p><p>“What?” ’Gina asked while taking the offered letter from Helene. “How<br/>did you get this?”</p><p>“It was in your mail slot. Diego told me I had some mail. When I went to<br/>get mine (he let’s me go in the mail room on my own) I saw you had a<br/>letter in your slot too, so I brought it up to you. Was that okay?”</p><p>“No. It’s fine. Thank you.” ’Gina turned the letter over in her hand,<br/>and looked at the seal on the back. She felt that it was slightly wavy,<br/>as if it had been exposed to moisture, but tearing it open she found<br/>what looked like one of the typical faux updates she received on the<br/>true news of Andalonia. If anyone had access to news from Andalonia they<br/>would find the stories true. They were of no real value to ’Gina, but<br/>she still liked reading the letters and pretending they were from her<br/>mother.</p><p>“What will you be doing for the weekend Helene? I am afraid I will have<br/>to study for our French and Math exams next week.”</p><p>“Oh. I’ll do that too.”</p><p>“No you will not,” ’Gina scolded with a smile. “Maybe French, but we<br/>both know you could teach that math class, and the Head Mistress knows<br/>it too.”</p><p>Helene looked down, embarrassed, but with a smile. “There’s something I<br/>wanted to ask you. I hope it’s okay, but maybe, no you don’t have to. I<br/>don’t know what I was …”</p><p>“Helene. Just ask me silly willy.” This made Helene giggle. ’Gina had<br/>felt suspicious when Helene brought her the letter that Diego, her<br/>brother, had given to the Head Mistress and then lied about. But she<br/>could not sustain her feeling. Helene was just too sweet and genuine.<br/>Too easily lost in self-doubt and embarrassment to succeed at<br/>subterfuge. She was not a friend in the way Mietzie was. She was more<br/>like a little sister, and ’Gina began to recognize that her attitude<br/>toward Helene showed some of the same characteristics ’Gina had<br/>witnessed in Albrecht and his siblings.</p><p>“Do you want to come to dinner <b>this</b> Friday? That’s what I wrote Mama<br/>and Father about. They said it was okay. You could come with me in the<br/>carriage. Or take your own. I don’t know. Is it okay for you to ride in<br/>a carriage without a royal seal? I didn’t think of that. You aren’t<br/>offended are you?”</p><p>’Gina laughed. “Of course I am not offended. And I would love to dine<br/>with your family this Friday, it would be such a pleasant distraction<br/>from school. It will put me in a fine mood for my weekend of study to<br/>begin with a family feast. Thank you so much for your kind invitation<br/>too.”</p><p>“Oh you’re welcome. I always talk about you at home, and Diego does too,<br/>and my father is always asking questions. It was his idea to invite you<br/>so soon. He said you would probably enjoy a nice home cooked meal, and<br/>we have two wonderful chefs. They can make whatever you want.”</p><p>And the two girls spent the next hour planning menus and picking out<br/>’Gina’s outfit for the Friday feast.</p></root><a href="chapter12.html">Prior Chapter Flight of the Bumblebee</a><p><a href="chapter14.html">Next Chapter Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner?</a></p></body></html>
