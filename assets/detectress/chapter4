Mietzie was true to her word, and<br/>soon ‘Gina had more beautiful hand-me-down dresses than she had teas to<br/>wear them to. But Mietzie was still a Princess with many duties, and<br/>their time for frolic was quite constrained. Mietzie had many tutors and<br/>many events, but all her breaks were spent with ‘Gina.</p><p>“Here’s another letter for you Regina.” said one of the chambermaids<br/>handing to the young girl a folded piece of thick lavender paper. Many<br/>of the downstairs staff had taken to calling ‘Gina Regina again, a<br/>slight increase in formality that accompanied her growing closeness to<br/>the royal family. They all still loved and doted on her. They neither<br/>regretted nor envied her her friendship. Regina was the sort of person<br/>for which one rooted. The staff had seen enough of Royals to know of<br/>their fickle nature. There was no reason to discourage Regina. The staff<br/>could let life teach Regina her lessons about Royal infatuations.<br/>Meanwhile, it was a very cynical person who did not share in the squeals<br/>of delight that echoed in the downstairs corridors as the two pre-teens,<br/>Mietzie and Regina, cavorted.</p><p>Despite Mietzie’s busy schedule, she and Regina corresponded as best<br/>they could across their royal divide. For lengthy correspondence they<br/>used the <b>Bed Post</b>. The chambermaid cleaning Mietzie’s rooms would find<br/>any letters Mietzie had written underneath Mietzie’s pillows. The maid<br/>would bring them downstairs to ’Gina when the maid brought down the<br/>dirty linen. Any responses written by ’Gina would be left for the same<br/>maid to place under Mietzie’s pillows the next day when the bed was<br/>made. It was a once a day exchange of events and gossip, but it was an<br/>effective way to arrange their next escapade.</p><p>Innovation though is driven by demands. Mietzie grew impatient for<br/>responses to her letters, and she chafed at not being able to send and<br/>receive shorter, more immediate messages. Thus, it was only a few weeks<br/>after the <b>Bed Post</b> had been established that Mietzie was found<br/>wandering the servants’ quarters with Queenie trailing. Mietzie had<br/>decided that they must have a better way of communicating.</p><p>“What are you doing down here now Love?” a chambermaid asked Mietzie as<br/>they passed. The rules of royal etiquette had evolved. Upstairs the<br/>staff bowed to the Royal Princess, but downstairs Mietzie was treated<br/>with respect, but without formality. She was addressed politely, but in<br/>a friendly fashion. Mietzie loved the freshness and affection such<br/>greetings contained. Upstairs, the maid knew to bow and Mietzie,<br/>reluctantly, knew she must demand it - she did not yet know why.</p><p>“Looking for ‘Gina. I sent her a letter this morning telling her that I<br/>could play. The viewing of the Palace Calvary was postponed to allow<br/>them to re-chrome the horseshoes or something.’’</p><p>“That would be my fault Dearie. Your letter is still in my pocket. I<br/>hain’t had time to get back down here ’til just now. Your Mother has<br/>guests and they are all demanding hot towels and cold sheets and better<br/>weather and other things I can’t provide. Here. I’ll go give it to her<br/>now…”</p><p>“No.” Mietzie interrupted. “You have your duties to attend to just like<br/>I do. Mother’s guests are more important.” A Princess learns to be<br/>gracious in disappointment, but a girl cannot completely hide her<br/>sorrow.</p><p>“Well, run along and see her now,” said the chambermaid. “She’s just in<br/>there with that tutor, and he never seems to be doing anything<br/>important. Like her future needs all them angles and equations. He ought<br/>to teach her how to box a bed sheet corner if he really wanted to be<br/>useful to her education.”</p><p>Mietzie did not fully comprehend the meaning of this remark, but focused<br/>on the part that made her happy, and skipped to the room where she knew<br/>‘Gina took her lessons. Mietzie shouted a loud “Bye Maid!” over her<br/>shoulder. The Chambermaid adjusted her burden of linens and almost<br/>managed a scowl before the smile broke through and she resumed her<br/>hurried waddle.</p><p>Mietzie knocked, and then entered the tutorial room. It was a noble name<br/>for a small pantry. Into one corner of the pantry had been wedged a<br/>small table. Above the table shelving had been anchored to the wall.<br/>Surrounded by preserves and mysterious canned goods was one linear foot<br/>of shelf that was labeled “Scholastic Library.” It was so declaimed by a<br/>handwritten sign thumb-tacked to it. Presently, it held two books<br/>provided by the tutor, and which were never to leave the “classroom” -<br/>except should the space be needed for storage of the Queen’s favorite<br/>confit.</p><p>The tutor rose and bowed when Mietzie entered. Although he taught Regina<br/>downstairs, he was not a downstairs person - nor really was he an<br/>upstairs person. Scholars were in-between people. Monsieur Franz was<br/>actually more of a no-stairs person. While he followed automatically and<br/>always the formality of upstairs life, he did so with an ease and<br/>casualness that suggested he did not take it too seriously. On the the<br/>other hand, he was too worldly to be fully accepted as a downstairs<br/>person. The downstairs people mocked him in his absence as Prof. Franzy<br/>Pants - but it was just high spirits, for they liked him out for the<br/>seriousness and professionalism that they saw him devote to Regina’s<br/>lessons. Their inference was that since they understood less and less of<br/>what it was ’Gina said, Monsieur Franz must be doing a good job with her<br/>education. Monsieur Franz always addressed ‘Gina as Miss Regina, and<br/>rising from his bow, he addressed the Princess Mietzie with:</p><p>“Bon jour ma Princesse. Comment allez vous?”</p><p>“Tres bien Monsieur Franz, et vous?”</p><p>“Tout va bien pour moi. Quelle désirez-vous?”</p><p>Mietzie could see the puzzle of incomprehension on ‘Gina’s face and<br/>switched to English.</p><p>“I came to join ‘Gina’s lesson. I had a break today. The horseshoes need<br/>to be shined or something, and I don’t have to go to parade this<br/>morning.’’</p><p>“Quelle miracle. Assiez vous s’il vous plait.”</p><p>“Merci Monsieur.”</p><p>“Hey! That’s not fair speaking in code.” ‘Gina’s face grew red.</p><p>Monsieur Franz responded. “We are not speaking in code. We are speaking<br/>French, Cheri. It is a language like ours, but spoken by people who live<br/>in another country, France, and a few other places. I spoke it with my<br/>Mémé - grandmother.”</p><p>“But we <b>should</b> have a code!” Mietzie interjected. “That way I could<br/>send messages without them being read by the maids who take our<br/>letters.”</p><p>“Or we could resume our geometry lesson,” said Monsieur Franz</p><p>“What’s a code?” asked ‘Gina</p><p>“It’s a private language that only you understand!” replied Mietzie.</p><p>“If only you understood it, it might be a code, but not a very useful<br/>one.” said Monsieur Franz. Being a good tutor he saw this as an<br/>opportunity to teach, even if it was not what had been scheduled. “A<br/>code is like a dictionary. It is like a book where you look up one<br/>letter or one word and find another word, letter, or symbol to replace<br/>it. There are many uses for codes. Sometimes it is to keep things<br/>secret, as Princess Mietzie has just suggested,” and he made a little<br/>deferential nod in her direction acknowledging and encouraging her<br/>learning. “But it can also be used for other reasons. To help people<br/>translate from one language to another, or it may be efficient and<br/>economical. For instance, our telegraph uses an alphabet with just two<br/>letters: the dot and the dash; the short and the long. From a<br/>combination of these we can represent all letters in our alphabet and<br/>some punctuation. Once you have letters you can string them together to<br/>make words, from their sentences, and with patience you could write a<br/>novel in this Morse Code.”</p><p>“But why would you want to do that?” ’Gina asked. “Why not just say the<br/>words?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mietzie echoed. “Just say the words.”</p><p>“But that may not be possible Mesdemoiselles. Right now Her Highness the<br/>Queen can communicate with all her realm using a telegraph. This is a<br/>line of wire that carries electricity. It only carries electricity. It<br/>is either off or on. There are only two states. It is necessary to make<br/>a code that can build up our words from these two states.”</p><p>“Could you give us an example Monsieur Franz? I still do not<br/>understand.” ‘Gina asked. Mietzie did not quite understand either. She<br/>had heard of telegrams of course, but did not really know what they<br/>meant, but being an upstairs person she did not have Regina’s permission<br/>to admit ignorance so freely, even when she was ignorant.</p><p>He paused a moment in thought. “Ah, the bells. Princess Mietzie, when<br/>you are in bed in the morning and need your hot water bottle refreshed,<br/>what do you do?”</p><p>“I pull my bell chord.” She replied.</p><p>“And how is it that they know it is you?” He asked.</p><p>“Well. I guess there must be different bells for different rooms,”<br/>Mietzie shot a quick glance at ‘Gina who nodded encouragement. “Yes.<br/>There are different bells, and they can see which one rang because it is<br/>still moving after I pull it.”</p><p>“Well that works when they are in the bell room, but what if there is no<br/>one to see the bell? Does that mean you must suffer cold feet?” He<br/>smiled as he asked this. “No. It does not happen. There must be more,<br/>but it is not the <b>more</b> a Princess would or should know, so let us ask<br/><b>downstairs</b>.” And he turned to look at Regina.</p><p>“They have different,” and here she slowed down to correctly pronounce a<br/>new word, “<b>pitches</b>. We know whose bell is ringing by sound alone.”</p><p>“But then there must be many different tones, excuse me, pitches? No?”<br/>asked Monsieur Franz (though he already knew the answer - Monsieur Franz<br/>could be tricky like that).</p><p>“Fifty-four. Over three octaves, and using fractional notes,” said<br/>‘Gina. “And when the Parson from church came to visit us once when the<br/>royal family was away….” She stopped suddenly. She was revealing a<br/>secret.</p><p>“We promise to never tell,” said Monsieur Franz winking slyly at a<br/>nodding Mietzie. “We know you can trust the Princess.”</p><p>“Well.” ’Gina did not hesitate long. She wanted to tell the story.<br/>“Well. The Parson came when the Queen was away, and he sat having a tea<br/>in the bell room with the Head Valet and Head Maid. I was watching from<br/>the door. He stood up to go, and bumped his head on one of the bells,<br/>and one of the chambermaids went rushing by in a fright. She was saying<br/>’They ain’t supposed to be anyone here.’ Her hair was really messy.” The<br/>two girls giggled, and Monsieur Franz smiled. “Anyway. The Parson called<br/>out to stop her. But then he started ringing bells on purpose, and more<br/>staff started running by. They would get stopped by the staff that had<br/>already run by. Soon there was a huge crowd outside the bell room, and<br/>all the while the Parson kept ringing the bells. Finally, one of the<br/>footmen said, sort of annoyed, ’Oy. What’cha doin’ there. Playing a<br/>bl… a symphony? Knock it off’. The Parson turned around and said, ’Not<br/>a symphony young man, a gymnopede. You know, I think I could do it now.’<br/>And he turned around and started plucking the bells strings quite fast,<br/>and it was music. Very pretty. Very sad. But he made us all aware that<br/>the different pitches made a melody, and now when you…” and she looked<br/>at Mietzie “.. all get up in the morning or need something at the same<br/>time we all hear it as a melody, and some of the maids make up words to<br/>sing to the song.”</p><p>“Oh. How clever. What do they sing about us?”</p><p>Monsieur Franz saw Regina’s face turn red, and he gallantly jumped in.<br/>“That is part of the secret that I am afraid Miss Regina is not allowed<br/>to share.” And he smiled at her. “Now, let us return to codes. This<br/>system of the bells only works because there are 54 tones, 54 symbols,<br/>characters, letters if you will. How would it work if there were only<br/>two? And that is why the Morse code - which has only two symbols: long<br/>and short; must use a series of symbols to make one letter.”</p><p>The two girls sat in reflection on this lesson for a moment, and then<br/>Mietzie looked up with the pleasant smile of knowledge gained, but,<br/>somewhat to Monsieur Franz’s surprise, as he privately thought Regina<br/>the more able and interested tutee, Regina sat with a clear look<br/>confusion on her face. He started to clarify, but ’Gina held up a hand<br/>to make hims stop. This surprised him, but before he could take affront<br/>’Gina looked up at him. “We could use the bells for Morse code. Will you<br/>teach us?”</p><p>“Merveilleux!” Monsieur Franz clapped his hands. Mietzie looked<br/>confused.</p><p>“See Mietzie.” ’Gina continued. “Instead of just pulling the bell a few<br/>times to get attention. You can pull it long or short jangles and make<br/>letters and send me messages.”</p><p>“Oh. Then I would have been able to tell you I was coming this morning,<br/>and we could have played instead of having a lesson,” Mietzie glanced<br/>apologetically at Monsieur Franz. “Je suis desolé Monsieur.”</p><p>“Pas de probleme. Je comprend. Vous sont jeunes filles. Vous preferez a<br/>jouer.”</p><p>“No French code!” Regina said. “Morse code.”</p><p>“I will teach you both the Morse code, and I will teach you some French.<br/>Agreed? D’accord?”</p><p>“But how will ‘Gina signal me?’’ Mietzie asked. “I can talk to her<br/>because there is a bell down here, but how will she talk to me? I won’t<br/>be able to hear it ring on my end?”</p><p>“The wires go from your room to here. There should be a way to make a<br/>wire go from here to there. And I know you two have a supporter in<br/>Monsieur Goldthread. I will tell him of your plan, in confidence<br/><b>naturellement</b>, and we will see if he can help.”</p><p>“But the messages can’t be too long.” ’Gina said. Her thoughts had raced<br/>beyond the implementation to the practicalities. “How will we know when<br/>one of us is done? And it could get confusing if the messages are too<br/>long and we get the symbols mixed up.”</p><p>“Okay. We can have symbols for spaces and periods.” Then catching<br/>Regina’s look of insight Mietzie amended, “I’ll bet Morse code already<br/>has those, because the telegraph operators would have the same problem.<br/>How about twenty words?” Mietzie asked, and then continued without<br/>waiting for an answer. “But words can be long and short. Twenty long<br/>words could be really long. Let’s say that a word is maybe seven<br/>letters, on average. Then twenty times seven is 140. We could say that<br/>we will limit all our messages to 140 characters.”</p><p>Regina agreed. “Yes. And now we can talk even when we can’t visit. This<br/>will be so much fun.”</p><p>“Yes it will.” said Monsieur Franz, “ But first you must learn the Morse<br/>code. Let us think about this code. Are there anythings that Mr. Morse<br/>might have considered when he invented it?” And without their quite<br/>realizing it, both young girls received twice the length of lesson they<br/>would have voluntarily sat still for.</p><p>The very next day workmen appeared upstairs and down, and soon, in the<br/>bell room, was a special rope, hung low, and with a small tag labeled<br/>“For Miss Regina’s Use Only.”</p><p>And in the following weeks the downstairs and upstairs rang like a<br/>Sunday cathedral. Long peels were followed by the sounds of feet running<br/>upstairs and down. “Did you get that?” “No!” “Try again!” “Did you call<br/>me a ’fiend’?” “Sorry. I forgot how to signal ’r’.” And for the first<br/>two weeks no one got their towels or hot water bottles on time, and no<br/>one complained.</p></root><a href="chapter3">Prior Chapter Apologia</a><p><a href="chapter5">Next Chapter Duty</a></p></body></html>
