A slim valet appeared in the<br/>door. “‘Gina.’’ he said in a half whisper, and then looked side to side<br/>slowly. “Prince Albrecht wants to see you, and he told me to tell you to<br/>come to his quarters the back-way.”</p><p>’Gina had never received a summons upstairs before for anything but tea,<br/>and that was always from the Queen and handled by Mr. Goldthread. ’Gina<br/>was not sure if she needed to wear her tea dress to see Albrecht, but<br/>decided against it since it was stained and since she had been<br/>instructed to go the back-way. That hardly sounded like a formal<br/>summons. Navigating quickly and expertly ‘Gina was soon knocking on the<br/>door in a servant’s passage that was, on its other side, a baize covered<br/>wall. The joint of the door was concealed by the edge of a large gilded<br/>mirror.</p><p>“You’ll just have to let yourself in ‘Gina.’’ a loud, resonant voice<br/>called out. “I have no idea how to open the thing.”</p><p>‘Gina entered and found Prince Albrecht, the Queen’s seventeen year old<br/>son, her eldest child, standing erect and handsome in some sort of<br/>uniform. He held two white gloves in his right hand. He was looking at<br/>himself in the mirror, and gave a start when door beside it opened.</p><p>“Oh. I thought the mirror was the door. Very clever. How does it work?”</p><p>‘Gina quickly demonstrated the mechanism, and then realized that she had<br/>forgotten to bow, or was it kneel? As all her presentations had been to<br/>the Queen she was not certain as to the right gesture of deference she<br/>was to show. She ended up with one knee half bent towards the floor<br/>while her head bobbed in a hesitant bow.</p><p>“What is wrong with you?” the Prince asked.</p><p>“I don’t know whether I am to kneel or bow to you?” ‘Gina replied.</p><p>“Neither. If we were in a public presentation you would curtsy, but as<br/>we are in a private rendezvous no such gesture is required.” And he<br/>continued as if he had prepared the next bit and wanted to get on with<br/>it. “See here ‘Gina,’’ (he had heard one of his Mother’s councilors<br/>address a subordinate with this phrase “See here” and thought it sounded<br/>just the right note of command and camaraderie) “you just have to work<br/>out this thing with Mietzie. It’s driving the rest of us batty. She was<br/>already difficult enough to start with.”</p><p>‘Gina responded, “I am afraid I don’t know what you are talking about<br/>your … Princeness”</p><p>“Yeesh. We have got to get you better informed on addresses and<br/>greetings,” and he made a note on a pad on his desk. “And please don’t<br/>call me Princeness again, too easy to sound like Princess. What I mean<br/>is you should apologize to Mietzie for making her feel bad. She’s not a<br/>bad kid you know. None of us really are. We’re just all spoiled by being<br/>these royal objects.”</p><p>’Gina looked back at Albrecht in silence. ’Gina had no difficulty with<br/>apologizing when she had committed an error, but she did not think she<br/>had in the tea time incident with Mietzie. As a servant’s child she had<br/>no familiarity with the concept of being spoiled. When Albrecht failed<br/>to continue speaking, ’Gina realized some comment on her part was<br/>required and she simply said, “Spoiled?”</p><p>“Yes. Spoiled. Don’t you know what that means?” Reflecting for a moment<br/>on his own question led Albrecht to provide his own answer. “Of course<br/>you don’t. The fact that I think you should know what spoiled means just<br/>shows how spoiled I am. Spoiled means everyone giving you what you want.<br/>You don’t turn out right that way. You think you are better, smarter,<br/>righter, than you really are. And you don’t even know for sure when you<br/>are right and you ought to stick to your guns. Maybe it is just someone<br/>telling you you are right when you are not. It is frankly very<br/>confusing, and a little disabling when you realize it is going on. You<br/>understand now?”</p><p>Never dissent, never dispute; that had been ’Gina’s training for dealing<br/>with Royals. “Yes m’lord.”</p><p>“My lord?! First, I am not a lord. Second, one only hears that in<br/>romantic novels. Where did that come from?”</p><p>“A … book” ‘Gina replied blushing.</p><p>“‘Gina!’’ and Albrecht’s voice was loud, angry, and frustrated. “’Gina!”<br/>he repeated. “Stop it. Just talk to me. You’re the one sane person in<br/>this household. Don’t you know that? That’s why Mother keeps you around.<br/>Everyone upstairs is so preoccupied with ceremony and decorum we can<br/>hardly have a conversation. My tutors are all business, and never want<br/>to offend. My friends, or so-called, are all sons of other <b>lesser</b><br/>Royals. They either have chips on their shoulders or regard me as some<br/>future employer and so are nearly as sycophantic as the downstairs<br/>staff, but at least with the staff there is a certain honesty in their<br/>obsequiousness. The staff have no power and are following the rules out<br/>of an honest self-interest. You seem to be one of the few who manages to<br/>snake between the two worlds and to be honest. I know you are still a<br/>child, so am I for a bit, but try to understand. I want to talk to you.<br/>To hear some real answers. To have a real exchange. Can you manage that?<br/>And in private just call me Albrecht.”</p><p>His passion had communicated his sincerity and so ‘Gina took a chance.<br/>“Yes Albrecht. But I still don’t understand what you mean by Mietzie<br/>being spoiled?”</p><p>“Thank you.” He took a breath before continuing. “I mean everyone gives<br/>us royal children whatever we want, so we don’t know what to do when we<br/>don’t get what we want, and sometimes we act poorly. But worse than<br/>that, when you discover what is going on - and how would you know what<br/>is going on when being spoiled is all you know - it also means that you<br/>can never trust anyone. If you do anything, everyone applauds. Is it<br/>because you are doing it well, or because you are Royal? That is why I<br/>wanted to talk to you specifically ‘Gina. The way you act with Mietzie<br/>and Mother, I mean the Queen, you are honest. I feel I can trust you to<br/>be true.’’</p><p>‘Gina asked, “Have you just learned about being spoiled?”</p><p>“See! That is what I mean. You see clearly, and you speak up, but you do<br/>it in a way that doesn’t seem like an attack. That’s what the Queen<br/>treasures, and we, her children do too - even if all of us don’t know it<br/>yet. Keep at it. Yes. Exactly. I was speaking with my fencing instructor<br/>about this topic the other day during my lesson. I knew what spoiled was<br/>in the abstract of course. And I was telling him that Mietzie was<br/>spoiled, and behaving badly about this whole cat thing. And I guess I<br/>was being a bit peevish about it and not very nice to Mietzie and as I<br/>was going on and on the next thing I knew the Instructor had won twenty<br/>touches in a row. Twenty! I was irate and broke my best epee. Monsieur<br/>had never gotten more than three touches in a row on me since I had<br/>turned 15. What had happened? Had I allowed myself to deteriorate so in<br/>my distraction? I ordered him out angrily. Then sitting here later it<br/>came to me: Monsieur had been spoiling me. Twenty touches. A hundred<br/>touches. He could have gone on forever. I could never beat him. And then<br/>I thought further. His spoiling could have killed me. I thought I was a<br/>great swordsman, but I wasn’t. What if I had relied on that knowledge in<br/>a fight or a dispute? It could have killed me.”</p><p>‘Gina interrupted. She seemed to easily adapt to informality. “I know<br/>what you mean! When I go to see Cook Patricia she always makes me jump<br/>to touch the ceiling. I know I can’t reach it, but she always makes me<br/>try. And if I don’t try hard enough she doesn’t give me a snack for<br/>Queenie. So I always try to jump to the ceiling even though I know I can<br/>never make it, but still I do jump higher than I thought I could. That’s<br/>what you mean: If Cook just gave me the treat, I wouldn’t know how to<br/>jump at all.”</p><p>“Exactly. I should talk to this Cook. She seems a poet in the kitchen.”<br/>And here he turned around and fished out a volume from the books on his<br/>desk. “I was just reading this for my English tutor. Robert Browning.<br/>Listen: ’Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, Or what’s a<br/>heaven for?’ Do you get it? He’s saying the same thing your cook is<br/>practicing.” And then more to himself than to ‘Gina. “There’s seem to be<br/>more wisdom hidden below floors than I had recognized.”</p><p>Albrecht continued, “So that is why I wanted to talk to you. Mietzie is<br/>spoiled, and she doesn’t know she is spoiled, but she is a good person,<br/>and she’s about your age, and I want you to help save her from being too<br/>spoiled. Apologize. Talk to her. Work this thing out. She could use an<br/>honest person or two in this house.”</p><p>‘Gina replied “But if I apologize to her when I haven’t done anything<br/>wrong, but she has, wouldn’t that be spoiling her too?”</p><p>Albrecht looked a bit deflated and sat down in the chair behind his<br/>desk. “Of course it would.” he said quietly, and then sighed. “See what<br/>it does, this spoiling. I have already been so spoiled I’ve gone<br/>rotten.” He smiled at his wordplay. Looking up he went on, “I am perhaps<br/>too old already to be saved. I’m seventeen. But Mietzie is young. She<br/>might have a chance. Do what you can will you?”</p><p>“I’ll try Albrecht. But I only see her at tea, and then we are all<br/>together. What can I do?”</p><p>“Hmm. I think I have an idea. Now you have to go, because I have to get<br/>ready for my fencing lesson. That should be fun. Winning every round<br/>again, and knowing it a fraud.”</p><p>“Okay.” ‘Gina said. “And tell your instructor you want all your lessons<br/>without him in his protection. How can he say ’No’ to the Prince? And<br/>when he starts to get nervous, you’ll know you are getting better.” And<br/>then she turned and left through the hidden, green baize door.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>A few days later, playing in a hallway with Queenie, ‘Gina heard a<br/>snippet of interesting conversation as two chamber maids walked by.</p><p>“It was the queerest thing. I was coming round the corner with a fresh<br/>chamber pot, and she was standing in the hall. I didn’t know it was her<br/>for a second, then I got down on me knees, and she told me she was lost,<br/>and so I showed her out, she was near the small library, so she could<br/>find her way back.”</p><p>“That is queer,” said the second chamber maid, “ ’cause I met her dusty<br/>in the ballroom side hall. She told me she had been playing with that<br/>fat cat of her’s, but she seemed sneaky like. It ain’t right. They have<br/>all that big space, and now she comes creeping into ours. How are we<br/>supposed to get our work done when you can’t go down a servant hall with<br/>a load and not having to stop and bow and scrape and all.”</p><p>“I know.” continued the first maid “I know. Do you still want to go<br/>watch a bit of Albrecht’s fencing practice through the gymnasium spy<br/>hole?”</p><p>“No.” said the second as their conversation faded down the hall. “What<br/>if she were to come up? Wouldn’t look right. She’s taking away what<br/>little fun we servants had.”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>A few days after her conversation with Albrecht ’Gina was studying in<br/>the small room off the laundry. Her mother was working in the laundry<br/>that week, and ’Gina liked being close. ’Gina was studying with a tutor<br/>the Queen had sent. ’Gina was considering the problem the tutor had just<br/>proposed when all of a sudden there was a quiet followed by a loud<br/>rustle. What had seemed a calm morning now became an eerie one as all<br/>the voices hushed. ‘Gina’s tutor seemed not to notice the change as the<br/>laundry kettles were still hissing and clanging, but ‘Gina knew<br/>something was not right. She got up from the table to peer outside the<br/>door. She saw all the laundry maids down on their knees and with their<br/>heads bowed. Standing before the maids at the laundry room door, her<br/>hair a dirty nest of cobwebs, smut on her forehead, and the front of her<br/>frock soiled, stood Princess Mary Miriam Marie, i.e. Mietzie. When<br/>Mietzie spied ‘Gina peaking around the door Mietzie let out a loud, “Ha.<br/>There you are. He said I could never find you. That it was too hard for<br/>me.”</p><p>On hearing Mietzie’s voice, Queenie, who had been snoozing in the<br/>rafters, leaped down to stand in front of ‘Gina’s legs and arch her back<br/>at the Princess. This made it difficult to curtsy, but ’Gina tried.<br/>After her meeting with Albrecht ’Gina had had one of the older butlers<br/>teach her, and as he had only seen it done, but never executed the<br/>maneuver himself, the lesson had been awkward, and not altogether<br/>successful.</p><p>“Greetings Princess. Welcome to the … laundry.”</p><p>“‘Gina. Now that I have found you we can have the apology. You hurt my<br/>feelings sneaking away like that.’’</p><p>Apparently it had not been as quiet as was possible for now it became<br/>more hushed still. It seemed even the laundry kettles were awed as their<br/>hissing became less vigorous (or it might have been that since the maids<br/>were on their knees they could not attend the fires and bellows that<br/>kept the kettles boiling, but in any case the laundry grew more quiet<br/>still).</p><p>‘Gina stood from her curtsy and Queenie hissed. ‘Gina thought hard about<br/>what Albrecht had told her. He was right. Mietzie was a nice girl who<br/>liked cats and pretty dresses, and who had the bravery and cunning to<br/>find her way into the servants’ depths, even if she had been, as ‘Gina<br/>surmised, tricked into it by Albrecht’s challenge.</p><p>‘Gina stiffened her body, trying to be brave, and thought about jumping<br/>high and grasping heaven. The slogan grew jumbled in her anxiety, but<br/>finally she knew what to say, and ’Gina said it while looking directly<br/>at Mietzie. “I am ready Princess. You may apologize whenever it suits<br/>you.”</p><p>Even the breathing of the bowing laundry maids ceased. In the corridor<br/>the sounds of servant traffic stopped. From the corner of her eye ‘Gina<br/>saw the tutor’s head peak out from behind the door. When he met<br/>Mietzie’s gaze he jerked back quickly. Like her own mouth the week<br/>before, ‘Gina saw Mietzie’s open and close noiselessly. Sensing that a<br/>compromise might help Mietzie, ‘Gina spoke, “But before you do, let me<br/>say that I am sorry if my sneaking away hurt your feelings, but you did<br/>say I had killed your cat, and because of you my only pretty dress is<br/>stained. And I don’t know if I will be able to come to tea anymore.” And<br/>on saying this silent tears began rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>“Oh ‘Gina’’ Mietzie said “I have lots of dresses you can use. Of course<br/>you must come to tea. I will tell Mother it was all my fault. She’ll<br/>understand. She loves cats, too. She has a Lioness named after her in a<br/>zoo you know?” Mietzie paused. Then she drew herself up straight, and<br/>looking ’Gina directly in the eye said, “I am sorry I said you killed<br/>Chevalier when it was you who found him.”</p><p>It is possible that the words came out so quickly and naturally that<br/>Mietzie did not at first realize that she had in fact apologized, but<br/>all the servants did and in the future they always greeted Mietzie with<br/>a smile, even when the maids found Mietzie playing in their passages.<br/>Mietzie would later play in the passages often, and when she did she<br/>would again feel proud of herself for her honesty (and Mietzie would be<br/>complimented for her honesty and courage by her Mother. Who knew how<br/>Mother learned of such things \[though it might have been via the tutor<br/>telling Mr. Goldthread (who might have, with approval, deduced elements<br/>of the plan the first time Mietzie was found in the servants’ passages)<br/>who let it “slip” to Albrecht who bragged about it to her Majesty\])?</p><p>‘Gina’s eyes went to the kneeling servants, and Mietzie’s followed. “Oh.<br/>Sorry again. All of you up please. I know you have work to do.” And then<br/>to ‘Gina. “It’s really amazing down here. Do you sleep here? Can I see<br/>your room? You’ve seen mine I know. I found the peep hole.” On hearing<br/>the change in the tone of voices Queenie moved to rub against Mietzie’s<br/>legs. “Is this Queenie? She is so handsome. May I give her a treat.”</p><p>‘Gina came to take Mietzie’s hand, and with Queenie in their arms they<br/>headed for the cooks’ pantry where they would create just as much<br/>confusion, chaos, and surprise, as they left behind them in the laundry.</p></root><a href="chapter2.html">Prior Chapter A Ghost Story</a><p><a href="chapter4.html">Next Chapter \#Friendship</a></p></body></html>
