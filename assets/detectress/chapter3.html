A slim valet appeared in thedoor. “‘Gina.’’ he said in a half whisper, and then looked side to sideslowly. “Prince Albrecht wants to see you, and he told me to tell you tocome to his quarters the back-way.”</p><p>’Gina had never received a summons upstairs before for anything but tea,and that was always from the Queen and handled by Mr. Goldthread. ’Ginawas not sure if she needed to wear her tea dress to see Albrecht, butdecided against it since it was stained and since she had beeninstructed to go the back-way. That hardly sounded like a formalsummons. Navigating quickly and expertly ‘Gina was soon knocking on thedoor in a servant’s passage that was, on its other side, a baize coveredwall. The joint of the door was concealed by the edge of a large gildedmirror.</p><p>“You’ll just have to let yourself in ‘Gina.’’ a loud, resonant voicecalled out. “I have no idea how to open the thing.”</p><p>‘Gina entered and found Prince Albrecht, the Queen’s seventeen year oldson, her eldest child, standing erect and handsome in some sort ofuniform. He held two white gloves in his right hand. He was looking athimself in the mirror, and gave a start when door beside it opened.</p><p>“Oh. I thought the mirror was the door. Very clever. How does it work?”</p><p>‘Gina quickly demonstrated the mechanism, and then realized that she hadforgotten to bow, or was it kneel? As all her presentations had been tothe Queen she was not certain as to the right gesture of deference shewas to show. She ended up with one knee half bent towards the floorwhile her head bobbed in a hesitant bow.</p><p>“What is wrong with you?” the Prince asked.</p><p>“I don’t know whether I am to kneel or bow to you?” ‘Gina replied.</p><p>“Neither. If we were in a public presentation you would curtsy, but aswe are in a private rendezvous no such gesture is required.” And hecontinued as if he had prepared the next bit and wanted to get on withit. “See here ‘Gina,’’ (he had heard one of his Mother’s councilorsaddress a subordinate with this phrase “See here” and thought it soundedjust the right note of command and camaraderie) “you just have to workout this thing with Mietzie. It’s driving the rest of us batty. She wasalready difficult enough to start with.”</p><p>‘Gina responded, “I am afraid I don’t know what you are talking aboutyour … Princeness”</p><p>“Yeesh. We have got to get you better informed on addresses andgreetings,” and he made a note on a pad on his desk. “And please don’tcall me Princeness again, too easy to sound like Princess. What I meanis you should apologize to Mietzie for making her feel bad. She’s not abad kid you know. None of us really are. We’re just all spoiled by beingthese royal objects.”</p><p>’Gina looked back at Albrecht in silence. ’Gina had no difficulty withapologizing when she had committed an error, but she did not think shehad in the tea time incident with Mietzie. As a servant’s child she hadno familiarity with the concept of being spoiled. When Albrecht failedto continue speaking, ’Gina realized some comment on her part wasrequired and she simply said, “Spoiled?”</p><p>“Yes. Spoiled. Don’t you know what that means?” Reflecting for a momenton his own question led Albrecht to provide his own answer. “Of courseyou don’t. The fact that I think you should know what spoiled means justshows how spoiled I am. Spoiled means everyone giving you what you want.You don’t turn out right that way. You think you are better, smarter,righter, than you really are. And you don’t even know for sure when youare right and you ought to stick to your guns. Maybe it is just someonetelling you you are right when you are not. It is frankly veryconfusing, and a little disabling when you realize it is going on. Youunderstand now?”</p><p>Never dissent, never dispute; that had been ’Gina’s training for dealingwith Royals. “Yes m’lord.”</p><p>“My lord?! First, I am not a lord. Second, one only hears that inromantic novels. Where did that come from?”</p><p>“A … book” ‘Gina replied blushing.</p><p>“‘Gina!’’ and Albrecht’s voice was loud, angry, and frustrated. “’Gina!”he repeated. “Stop it. Just talk to me. You’re the one sane person inthis household. Don’t you know that? That’s why Mother keeps you around.Everyone upstairs is so preoccupied with ceremony and decorum we canhardly have a conversation. My tutors are all business, and never wantto offend. My friends, or so-called, are all sons of other <b>lesser</b>Royals. They either have chips on their shoulders or regard me as somefuture employer and so are nearly as sycophantic as the downstairsstaff, but at least with the staff there is a certain honesty in theirobsequiousness. The staff have no power and are following the rules outof an honest self-interest. You seem to be one of the few who manages tosnake between the two worlds and to be honest. I know you are still achild, so am I for a bit, but try to understand. I want to talk to you.To hear some real answers. To have a real exchange. Can you manage that?And in private just call me Albrecht.”</p><p>His passion had communicated his sincerity and so ‘Gina took a chance.“Yes Albrecht. But I still don’t understand what you mean by Mietziebeing spoiled?”</p><p>“Thank you.” He took a breath before continuing. “I mean everyone givesus royal children whatever we want, so we don’t know what to do when wedon’t get what we want, and sometimes we act poorly. But worse thanthat, when you discover what is going on - and how would you know whatis going on when being spoiled is all you know - it also means that youcan never trust anyone. If you do anything, everyone applauds. Is itbecause you are doing it well, or because you are Royal? That is why Iwanted to talk to you specifically ‘Gina. The way you act with Mietzieand Mother, I mean the Queen, you are honest. I feel I can trust you tobe true.’’</p><p>‘Gina asked, “Have you just learned about being spoiled?”</p><p>“See! That is what I mean. You see clearly, and you speak up, but you doit in a way that doesn’t seem like an attack. That’s what the Queentreasures, and we, her children do too - even if all of us don’t know ityet. Keep at it. Yes. Exactly. I was speaking with my fencing instructorabout this topic the other day during my lesson. I knew what spoiled wasin the abstract of course. And I was telling him that Mietzie wasspoiled, and behaving badly about this whole cat thing. And I guess Iwas being a bit peevish about it and not very nice to Mietzie and as Iwas going on and on the next thing I knew the Instructor had won twentytouches in a row. Twenty! I was irate and broke my best epee. Monsieurhad never gotten more than three touches in a row on me since I hadturned 15. What had happened? Had I allowed myself to deteriorate so inmy distraction? I ordered him out angrily. Then sitting here later itcame to me: Monsieur had been spoiling me. Twenty touches. A hundredtouches. He could have gone on forever. I could never beat him. And thenI thought further. His spoiling could have killed me. I thought I was agreat swordsman, but I wasn’t. What if I had relied on that knowledge ina fight or a dispute? It could have killed me.”</p><p>‘Gina interrupted. She seemed to easily adapt to informality. “I knowwhat you mean! When I go to see Cook Patricia she always makes me jumpto touch the ceiling. I know I can’t reach it, but she always makes metry. And if I don’t try hard enough she doesn’t give me a snack forQueenie. So I always try to jump to the ceiling even though I know I cannever make it, but still I do jump higher than I thought I could. That’swhat you mean: If Cook just gave me the treat, I wouldn’t know how tojump at all.”</p><p>“Exactly. I should talk to this Cook. She seems a poet in the kitchen.”And here he turned around and fished out a volume from the books on hisdesk. “I was just reading this for my English tutor. Robert Browning.Listen: ’Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, Or what’s aheaven for?’ Do you get it? He’s saying the same thing your cook ispracticing.” And then more to himself than to ‘Gina. “There’s seem to bemore wisdom hidden below floors than I had recognized.”</p><p>Albrecht continued, “So that is why I wanted to talk to you. Mietzie isspoiled, and she doesn’t know she is spoiled, but she is a good person,and she’s about your age, and I want you to help save her from being toospoiled. Apologize. Talk to her. Work this thing out. She could use anhonest person or two in this house.”</p><p>‘Gina replied “But if I apologize to her when I haven’t done anythingwrong, but she has, wouldn’t that be spoiling her too?”</p><p>Albrecht looked a bit deflated and sat down in the chair behind hisdesk. “Of course it would.” he said quietly, and then sighed. “See whatit does, this spoiling. I have already been so spoiled I’ve gonerotten.” He smiled at his wordplay. Looking up he went on, “I am perhapstoo old already to be saved. I’m seventeen. But Mietzie is young. Shemight have a chance. Do what you can will you?”</p><p>“I’ll try Albrecht. But I only see her at tea, and then we are alltogether. What can I do?”</p><p>“Hmm. I think I have an idea. Now you have to go, because I have to getready for my fencing lesson. That should be fun. Winning every roundagain, and knowing it a fraud.”</p><p>“Okay.” ‘Gina said. “And tell your instructor you want all your lessonswithout him in his protection. How can he say ’No’ to the Prince? Andwhen he starts to get nervous, you’ll know you are getting better.” Andthen she turned and left through the hidden, green baize door.</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>A few days later, playing in a hallway with Queenie, ‘Gina heard asnippet of interesting conversation as two chamber maids walked by.</p><p>“It was the queerest thing. I was coming round the corner with a freshchamber pot, and she was standing in the hall. I didn’t know it was herfor a second, then I got down on me knees, and she told me she was lost,and so I showed her out, she was near the small library, so she couldfind her way back.”</p><p>“That is queer,” said the second chamber maid, “ ’cause I met her dustyin the ballroom side hall. She told me she had been playing with thatfat cat of her’s, but she seemed sneaky like. It ain’t right. They haveall that big space, and now she comes creeping into ours. How are wesupposed to get our work done when you can’t go down a servant hall witha load and not having to stop and bow and scrape and all.”</p><p>“I know.” continued the first maid “I know. Do you still want to gowatch a bit of Albrecht’s fencing practice through the gymnasium spyhole?”</p><p>“No.” said the second as their conversation faded down the hall. “Whatif she were to come up? Wouldn’t look right. She’s taking away whatlittle fun we servants had.”</p><p>————————————————————————</p><p>A few days after her conversation with Albrecht ’Gina was studying inthe small room off the laundry. Her mother was working in the laundrythat week, and ’Gina liked being close. ’Gina was studying with a tutorthe Queen had sent. ’Gina was considering the problem the tutor had justproposed when all of a sudden there was a quiet followed by a loudrustle. What had seemed a calm morning now became an eerie one as allthe voices hushed. ‘Gina’s tutor seemed not to notice the change as thelaundry kettles were still hissing and clanging, but ‘Gina knewsomething was not right. She got up from the table to peer outside thedoor. She saw all the laundry maids down on their knees and with theirheads bowed. Standing before the maids at the laundry room door, herhair a dirty nest of cobwebs, smut on her forehead, and the front of herfrock soiled, stood Princess Mary Miriam Marie, i.e. Mietzie. WhenMietzie spied ‘Gina peaking around the door Mietzie let out a loud, “Ha.There you are. He said I could never find you. That it was too hard forme.”</p><p>On hearing Mietzie’s voice, Queenie, who had been snoozing in therafters, leaped down to stand in front of ‘Gina’s legs and arch her backat the Princess. This made it difficult to curtsy, but ’Gina tried.After her meeting with Albrecht ’Gina had had one of the older butlersteach her, and as he had only seen it done, but never executed themaneuver himself, the lesson had been awkward, and not altogethersuccessful.</p><p>“Greetings Princess. Welcome to the … laundry.”</p><p>“‘Gina. Now that I have found you we can have the apology. You hurt myfeelings sneaking away like that.’’</p><p>Apparently it had not been as quiet as was possible for now it becamemore hushed still. It seemed even the laundry kettles were awed as theirhissing became less vigorous (or it might have been that since the maidswere on their knees they could not attend the fires and bellows thatkept the kettles boiling, but in any case the laundry grew more quietstill).</p><p>‘Gina stood from her curtsy and Queenie hissed. ‘Gina thought hard aboutwhat Albrecht had told her. He was right. Mietzie was a nice girl wholiked cats and pretty dresses, and who had the bravery and cunning tofind her way into the servants’ depths, even if she had been, as ‘Ginasurmised, tricked into it by Albrecht’s challenge.</p><p>‘Gina stiffened her body, trying to be brave, and thought about jumpinghigh and grasping heaven. The slogan grew jumbled in her anxiety, butfinally she knew what to say, and ’Gina said it while looking directlyat Mietzie. “I am ready Princess. You may apologize whenever it suitsyou.”</p><p>Even the breathing of the bowing laundry maids ceased. In the corridorthe sounds of servant traffic stopped. From the corner of her eye ‘Ginasaw the tutor’s head peak out from behind the door. When he metMietzie’s gaze he jerked back quickly. Like her own mouth the weekbefore, ‘Gina saw Mietzie’s open and close noiselessly. Sensing that acompromise might help Mietzie, ‘Gina spoke, “But before you do, let mesay that I am sorry if my sneaking away hurt your feelings, but you didsay I had killed your cat, and because of you my only pretty dress isstained. And I don’t know if I will be able to come to tea anymore.” Andon saying this silent tears began rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>“Oh ‘Gina’’ Mietzie said “I have lots of dresses you can use. Of courseyou must come to tea. I will tell Mother it was all my fault. She’llunderstand. She loves cats, too. She has a Lioness named after her in azoo you know?” Mietzie paused. Then she drew herself up straight, andlooking ’Gina directly in the eye said, “I am sorry I said you killedChevalier when it was you who found him.”</p><p>It is possible that the words came out so quickly and naturally thatMietzie did not at first realize that she had in fact apologized, butall the servants did and in the future they always greeted Mietzie witha smile, even when the maids found Mietzie playing in their passages.Mietzie would later play in the passages often, and when she did shewould again feel proud of herself for her honesty (and Mietzie would becomplimented for her honesty and courage by her Mother. Who knew howMother learned of such things \[though it might have been via the tutortelling Mr. Goldthread (who might have, with approval, deduced elementsof the plan the first time Mietzie was found in the servants’ passages)who let it “slip” to Albrecht who bragged about it to her Majesty\])?</p><p>‘Gina’s eyes went to the kneeling servants, and Mietzie’s followed. “Oh.Sorry again. All of you up please. I know you have work to do.” And thento ‘Gina. “It’s really amazing down here. Do you sleep here? Can I seeyour room? You’ve seen mine I know. I found the peep hole.” On hearingthe change in the tone of voices Queenie moved to rub against Mietzie’slegs. “Is this Queenie? She is so handsome. May I give her a treat.”</p><p>‘Gina came to take Mietzie’s hand, and with Queenie in their arms theyheaded for the cooks’ pantry where they would create just as muchconfusion, chaos, and surprise, as they left behind them in the laundry.</p></root><a href="chapter2.html">Prior Chapter A Ghost Story</a><p><a href="chapter4.html">Next Chapter \#Friendship</a></p></body></html>
