#+Title: What's in a name?

The purpose of this blog is to provide a sandbox for playing and practicing with new tools related to blogging, not really to share content. So why then do I spend so much time thinking about a title? If I was going to title it based on the audience of readers I could call it "Me, Myself, and I." Does anyone else waste too much time this way?
