I have recently learned of a Portuguese New Year's tradition where you eat twelve raisins as the clock tolls midnight. Each raisin represents one month of the coming year and in the version I learned you make one wish for each raisin: one wish for each month of the year to come.

When compared to the North American tradition of New Year's resolutions this one seems preferable. One thinks discretely and concretely about the year to come, and, at least in my case, made me think about what I could do to contribute to each month's opportunities.

This blog is my idea overflow. The place where I intended to put the experimental meanderings and odd one-offs that were not really "academic" (thus not fitting on the [[https://brittlab.uwaterloo.ca][lab site]]), but were still things that I wanted to pollinate the blog-o-sphere with. However, in practice it has not really worked out that way. Months (sometimes a year or more) go by with no entry. Then I change the software I use to produce the blog, write one post to proclaim that fact and my good intentions, and then silence. 

In the raisin spirit I decided to make this my raisin-/d'etre/ for the year and come up with one blog title for each month of the year in an effort to encourage and guilt myself into writing on this blog more often.

This obviously counts as the January entry[fn:1], but here are some tentative ideas that I intend to produce for the remainder of the year.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Note that it is appearing in February. Probably not a great omen for the coming year. And should not be interpreted as maligning a great Portuguese tradition.
