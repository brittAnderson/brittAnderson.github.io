        <p>I think <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nixos</a> is the right way to run an operating system. I think declarative and reproducible are the future, and I don’t think I am particularly forward in this thinking. Cabal basically is doing this with the new-build set of tools, and <a href="https://shopify.engineering/what-is-nix">Nix now is adopted by Shopify</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is an anti-sweet spot for the adoption of nixos. If you are a very basic user and just want to run a basic desktop then nixos is ready to go and you should adopt it. I did not have too much trouble getting things to work even on a Surface Go. The plasma desktop was great, and with gnome even screen rotation worked. If you are a cutting edge user then you can use Nix as well as anything else and the need to learn a new special purpose one-off language for installing software is not big deal. However, if you are in between these cases then using Nixos can be painful. You have a desire to try out new tools, and not enough time or knowledge to be able to make them work in all the special cases that arise.</p>
<p>I need to use <a href="https://www.psychopy.org">Psychopy</a> for the programming of experiments in psychology. That python package requires knowing where a lot of other tools are, and that means you can’t expect all the symlinks built by Nix to work quite how you expect. Want to try other programming languages: Idris or Idris2. Those need other compilers and to get things working I had to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois">depend on the kindness</a> of strangers. And there are many kind strangers out there in the world of programming languages, but it is a brittle dependency. I think the straw that broke the camel’s back was <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>. There is a lot of hum around this language in scientific computing, and it also attaches to the math-y world of <a href="https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl">Category Theory</a>. While the julia compiler is no problem <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/using-julia-with-nixos/35129">the packages are</a>. If everytime you want to spend an afternoon playing with some new tool in a REPL you have to spend many days figuring out the installation then you end up not playing with the new tool. Maybe in some cases that is a beneficial protection against distraction. But if you believe that new insights can come from the fertile ground of intellectual play <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, it is a bad thing indeed.</p>
<p>For now I am warmly back into the world of ArchLinux where I may occassionally use the nix package manager tool for the occasional <a href="https://github.com/dmjio/miso">special case</a>. I look forward to the day when time, documentation, and even wider adoption allow me to try Nixos for the third time and stick with it.</p>
