I have spent a lot of time lately thinking about what programming language to use for a new project, and also thinking about whether it is productive to be thinking about which programming language to use for a new project?

After all as long as it is Turing complete any of them can do what any of the others of them can. But it does seem that there are some idioms that are easier to express in one venacular than another. We could use Roman numerals, but we don't. Not because Roman numerals are not capable of representing arithmetic, but because it is easier to use the base 10 system. So, maybe it does make sense to spend time thinking about programming languages in the context of an intended project?

I am interested in trying to find a language for expressing clearly connections between mind, theory, math, and code. Some I have considered so far are haskell, python, r, julia, racket, and now common lisp. Perhaps some day I will write more on all these different considerations another day. The core challenge seems to be a trade-off between the expressibility of a language, the flexibility of a language, and the availability of well-written and actively maintained libraries for a language. 

The questions upper most in my mind at the moment are:

> Is the mapping from inchoate ideas to code cleaner in lisp? 

> Does it say anything about the structure of our ideas if this is the case? 

> Can we infer something about the structure of our ideas by analyzing the structure of the lisp language?
