# Britt Anderson

I am a behavioral neurologist and cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I am a member of the [Dept. of Psychology](https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/ "Psych Dept University of Waterloo") and the university's[ Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-theoretical-neuroscience/ "CTN"). My current interests are loosely grouped around the question of how is it we represent uncertainty? Do we have a conceptual space for probability? It seems probability is treated as a cognitive primary by everybody invoking the Bayesian brain, and thus implicitly this idea is endorsed. But for stuff along those lines consult the [brittlab website](https://brittlab.uwaterloo.ca "brittlab website link"). Here you will get more general musings. Some will be on my science, but usually those scienc-y posts are the ones that I think are just a bit too abstract or inchoate to warrant being put on the lab website. And of course everything else is game for inclusion here.
