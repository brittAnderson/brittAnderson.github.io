*** A creation narrative for category theory
In the beginning was chaos.

Let there be objects.

Each object was unique. It had its identity. But they were alone.

Co-mpanions for objects, source and target, the ties that bind.

Go forth and multiply. For each mate-able arrow there shall be another.

There are no favored creations. When a and b beget c that mates with d it will be one with the begetting of a with that which was beget by b and d.

And now for all the rest ...
